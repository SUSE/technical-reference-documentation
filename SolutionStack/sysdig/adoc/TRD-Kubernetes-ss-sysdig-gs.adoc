== Motivation

Security for containers and Kubernetes requires new approaches to ensure visibility and control. Sysdig Secure is designed to help DevOps teams simplify security in cloud-native environments, from development through production.

Sysdig provides a number of capabilities to help you security run applications on SUSE Rancher:

* *Secure the build* – Automate image scanning in CI/CD pipelines and registries, efficiently flag vulnerabilities and owners, and block risky images.
* *Detect and respond to threats* – Identify threats across containers and cloud services and to prevent intrusion and lateral movement. Respond quickly and conduct forensics using detailed activity audits.
* *Continuously validate cloud configurations and compliance* – Identify misconfigurations and compliance violations, and measure progress with detailed reports. Save time with out-of-the-box policies for standards such as PCI, NIST, HIPAA, and SOC 2.
* *Monitor and troubleshoot infrastructure and services*  – Maximize performance and availability using Kubernetes and cloud monitoring with full Prometheus compatibility.

If your organization relies on SUSE Rancher to run cloud-native applications and need to enhance visibility and security of your clusters and containers, this guide will help you take the first steps to integrate Rancher with the Sysdig Secure SaaS solution. If you’re not a Sysdig customer, you can still take advantage of the solution and learn what’s possible by using a Sysdig Free Trial account.

Audience: DevOps and DevSecOps engineers, Security professionals, and Developers who are responsible for enabling security across containers, clusters, and cloud.

== Technical overview

Sysdig security and monitoring capabilities for SUSE Rancher are enabled by deploying the Sysdig agent on the nodes of your cluster. Relevant data and metadata are collected and available in the Sysdig SaaS backend and accessible via the Sysdig user interface (UI). The Sysdig UI also provides the ability for you to customize aspects like policies, alerts, visualizations, permissions, etc.
Minimum requirements:

* A Sysdig cloud account. You can get started with a free trial by visiting https://sysdig.com/start-free/[https://sysdig.com/start-free].
* A SUSE Rancher cluster running K8s or K3s. Clusters can be located on premises or in the cloud.
* Outbound internet access (at least port 6443). This allows collected information to be sent to the Sysdig back end. You can learn more in the Sysdig documentation here.

You can find the prerequisites for the Sysdig agent install on Kubernetes in the Sysdig documentation https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/installation/sysdig-agent/agent-installation/agent-install-kubernetes/#agent-install-kubernetes[here].

== Installation

To get started, install the Sysdig agent in your cluster. Choose one of the following methods:

* *Install from Rancher Apps & Marketplace:*  From the top-left Rancher menu select “Apps & Marketplace.”

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-marketplace.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

You will be taken to the Charts page. Locate Sysdig Monitor & Secure to install using the Sysdig https://github.com/sysdiglabs/charts-rancher[helm chart.]

This will automate the installation of the Sysdig agent. In the UI, you will need to provide a namespace and the https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/administration/administration-settings/agent-installation-overview-and-key/#agent-installation-overview-and-key[Sysdig access key.]

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-install-2.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

Once you initiate the helm chart, within 15 minutes you should begin seeing data and activity in your Sysdig UI.

* *Install using generic/manual steps:*  To install the Sysdig agent using manual steps, follow the instructions https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/installation/sysdig-agent/agent-installation/agent-install-kubernetes/steps-for-rancher/#steps-for-rancher[available in the Sysdig documentation.]


== Demo / Use case

*Configuring a Runtime Security Policy*

Sysdig Secure runtime security provides policy-driven detections, based on open-source https://falco.org[Falco.] Using out-of-the-box and custom policies, you can automate detection and alerting of suspicious and unexpected activity across containers, clusters, and clouds.

Let’s look at a specific example. In the following use case, we’ll create a custom policy that will detect when a shell is spawned in a container with an attached terminal. Commands being executed with a terminal inside a running container can be an indicator of a potential infiltration or attack.

NOTE: For the sake of this example we are creating a *simple* custom rule that can be inhibited by other rules, thus we strongly recommend disallowing “Suspicious Container Activity” default rule before adding the new rule (Policies > Runtime Policies > Suspicious Container Activity).  After the experiment you may want to reactivate it again.


Log in to Sysdig Secure, and In the Sysdig UI, on the left panel, select Policies > Runtime Policies.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-select-runtime.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

This opens the *Runtime Policies* screen where you can see the policies pre-defined by Sysdig.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-Runtime-Policies.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

Let’s create our own, custom policy that will detect terminal shell activity. Select Add Policy in the upper right corner. In the pop-up screen, select Workload Policy.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-choose-policy.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

In the New Policy screen, enter a name and a description:

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-new-policy-name.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

Keep the policy defaults: Enabled with severity level of High. You can customize the scope of this rule, indicating where it should apply. In our example, we’ve scoped it to a namespace called terminal-shell-in-container. You can also set this to a broader scope, such as kubernetes.cluster.name, for example.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-policy-scope.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

Next, you’ll want to assign a rule to use with the policy. Select Import from Library.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-import.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

Find and select Terminal shell in a container in the Rules Library, then click in Import Rules.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-rules-library.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

You should now see the Terminal shell in a container rule assigned to your policy.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-rule-config.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

Next, under Actions, you can choose whether you’d like to kill, stop, or pause the container when the policy is triggered. Read more about Actions https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/policies/manage-policies/#define-actions[here].  Leave this set to Nothing for this exercise.

You can also select a notification channel. Your email will be the default notification channel. You can configure additional options under settings > notification channels. In our example, we’ve chosen Slack Channel from our list of options.  You can also leave this blank.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-actions-config.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

Finally, you can enable a Capture to record system call data surrounding an event. For this exercise, toggle on the capture, provide a file name, and choose the number of seconds before and after the event to record. For example, 10 seconds before, and 20 seconds after the event.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-capture-config.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

When the above steps are complete, click on Save.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-save-policy.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

*Triggering a Test Event*

Using the below test instructions, you can trigger a test event to observe how Sysdig Secure detects the terminal shell in a container event. In addition, you’ll be able to drill into the information captured to help you investigate the incident.

*Opening a terminal shell using Rancher*

You can open a terminal shell from any container that is running in your Rancher cluster. Simply go to the Workloads section and get into any Pod with at least a running container (we used the self sysdig agent pod in this example)

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-open-terminal-shell-from-rancher-ui-1.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

From the right menu you can click “Execute Shell” option and a new terminal shell will be shown at the bottom of the screen.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-open-terminal-shell-from-rancher-ui-2.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

That is enough to be caught in red-handed by Sysdig Secure.

You can also type a few commands of your choice to generate additional data that will be captured by Sysdig. In our example below, you will see this type of information captured as we investigate the activity we generated our Sysdig/Rancher test environment.

*Viewing and Investigating the Event in Sysdig Secure*

Once the runtime security policy created above is triggered, you can click on Events in the left pane to view more information about the event.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-events.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

Next, click on the Terminal shell in a container entry to open and view additional information about the event. You can scroll through this panel to see information such as:

* Information about the policy and rule(s) triggered

* Details about where the activity took place in your cluster (Scope), including what container as well as the detected process (in this case, bash)

* “Tags” that indicate applicable compliance standards violated, etc.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-event-details.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

To dig deeper, click on Respond at the top of this panel, and select, View Activity Audit.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-view-audit.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

In the *Activity Audit* screen you will find details about the incident, including commands issued, file activity, network activity and kube exec activity.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-activity-audit.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

If you click on a line item, you’ll see additional details such as user, host, and scope.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-Kubernetes-details.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

In addition to the Activity Audit, you can also open the Capture file created when the incident triggered to drill into further detail such as the contents of files written and/or read.

Select Captures from the top of the *Activity Audit* page.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-view-capture-1.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

Then, to the right of the Terminal shell in a container capture file, click the shovel icon to open the capture automatically with Sysdig Inspect.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-view-capture-2.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

A new tab will open that presents you with a set of tiles that categorize the available details within the capture file. You can select any of these tiles to identify where the activity is within the timeline and drag the bars at the bottom to narrow into a specific area within the file.

image::TRD-Kubernetes-ss-sysdig-gs-image-Inspect.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

Next, if you click on one of the tiles such as Executed Interactive Commands, you will be able to view further information about that particular activity and continue to drill down and investigate the incident.
