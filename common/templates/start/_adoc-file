== Introduction

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a motivation for the document in 2-4 sentences to identify:
//   - what the document is about
//   - why it may be of interest to the reader (e.g., a use case)
//   - what products are being highlighted
// Include an approved SUSE | Partner logo lock-up if possible
// Include any additional, relevant details
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =




=== Scope

// Specify what this guide covers in no more than 2 sentences.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This guide will help you take the first steps to ...



=== Audience

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify for whom this document is intended, perhaps with:
//   - topics of interests (e.g., machine learning, security, etc.)
//   - job roles (e.g., developer, administrator, platform architect, etc.)
//   - required skills
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This document is intended for ...



=== Acknowledgements

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Acknowledge contributors not listed as authors.
// Something like:
//   The authors wish to acknowledge the contributions of the following
//   individuals:
//   * {contrib1-firstname} {contrib1-surname}, {contrib1-jobtitle}, {contrib1-orgname}
//   * {contrib2-firstname} {contrib2-surname}, {contrib2-jobtitle}, {contrib2-orgname}
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =





== Prerequisites

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify minimum requirements (prerequisites) the reader
// would need in order to follow the steps of this guide.
// - Link to existing resources whenever possible.
// - Keep this section brief but elaborate as needed.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

To complete the steps illustrated in this guide, you need the following resources:

* Prerequisite 1

* Prerequisite 2




== Overview

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide an overview of the solution and the processes detailed
// in this guide.
// - Identify components
// - Describe how the components fit together
//   Leverage diagrams as appropriate, including (but not limited to):
//   - component architecture
//   - data flow diagram
//   - workflow diagram
//  - Summarize the major steps the reader will perform
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =






== Installation

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Detail the steps of the installation procedure.
// The reader should be able to copy and paste commands to
// a local environment or follow along locally with screenshots.
// Be sure tp include verifications that the reader can use to
// validate that major steps were performed correctly.
//
// Leverage:
// - Ordered lists
// - Code blocks
// - Screenshots
// - Admonitions
//
// If multiple installation methods are to be detailed, then
// - Create a summary list here
// - Detail each method in its own subsection.
//
// NOTE: For solutions involving SUSE Rancher, it is preferred
//       to highlight installation through the Rancher Apps Catalog
//       with appropriate screenshots and SUSE branding.
//       Alternatively or additionally, installation via the
//       command line can be documented.
//
// Complex installations may be broken into one or more sections
// or subsections.
//
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =






== Demonstration

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Illustrate functionality of the solution for a use case.
//
// NOTE: This demonstration text could be used to script a
//       demonstration video.
//
// Typical demonstration flow is:
// 1. Outline the demonstration.
// 2. Prepare the environment.
//    This should be minimal, such as downloading some data to use.
// 3. Perform the demonstration.
//    Do not overuse screenshots.
// 4. Clean up the environment.
//
// As with Installation, leverage ordered lists, code blocks,
// admonitions, and screenshots.
//
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =





== Summary

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Summarize:
// - Motivation (1 sentence)
// - What was covered (1-2 sentences)
// - Next steps (unordered list of 2-4 further learning resources)
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
