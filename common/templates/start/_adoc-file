// General comments
// Keep in mind that this is a "getting started" guide and the
//   audience that you are trying to reach.
// Leverage ASCIIDoc features to make this document readable and usable:
//   - Text highlights (follow SUSE style guides)
//   - Admonitions (i.e., NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, CAUTION, WARNING)
//   - Code blocks
//   - Lists (ordered and unordered, as appropriate)
//   - Links (to other resources)
//   - Images
//     - Place image files under the ./media directory tree
//       (e.g., ./media/src/svg, ./media/src/png)
//     - Format preference: svg > png > jpg
//     - Consolidate images wherever possible
//       (i.e., don't use two images when one conveys the message)
//   - Use sections and subsections to organize and group related
//     steps.

== Introduction

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a brief statement (1-4 sentences) of the purpose of the guide.
// This is could be the same as the executive summary.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =



=== Motivation

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a motivation for the document in 2-4 sentences to identify:
//   - what the document is about
//   - why it may be of interest to the reader (e.g., a use case)
//   - what products are being highlighted
// Include an approved SUSE | Partner logo lock-up if possible
// Include any additional, relevant details
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =



=== Scope

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Specify what this guide covers in no more than 2 sentences.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This guide will help you take the first steps to ...


=== Audience

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify for whom this document is intended, perhaps with:
//   - topics of interests (e.g., machine learning, security, etc.)
//   - job roles (e.g., developer, administrator, platform architect, etc.)
//   - required skills
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This document is intended for ...


== Prerequisites

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify minimum requirements (prerequisites) the reader
// would need in order to follow the steps of this guide.
// - Link to existing resources whenever possible.
// - Keep this section brief but elaborate as needed.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =




== Technical overview

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a technical overview of the solution.
// - Identify components.
// - Describe how the components fit together.
//   Leverage diagrams as appropriate, including (but not limited to):
//   - component architecture
//   - data flow diagram
//   - workflow diagram
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =





== Installation

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Detail the steps of the installation procedure.
// The reader should be able to copy and paste commands to
// a local environment or follow along locally with screenshots.
// Include one or more verification steps to validate installation.
//
// Leverage:
// - Ordered lists
// - Code blocks
// - Screenshots
// - Admonitions
//
// If multiple installation methods are to be detailed, then
// - Create a summary list here
// - Detail each method in its own subsection.
//
// NOTE: For solutions involving SUSE Rancher, it is preferred
//       to detail two installation methods:
//       - Through the Rancher Apps Catalog with appropriate
//         screenshots and SUSE branding.
//       - A more manual approach (e.g., on the command-line).
//
// Complex configuration procedures may be broken out into one or more
// Configuration sections.
// These may be subsections of Installation or separate sections at
// the same level as Installation.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =





== Demonstration

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Illustrate functionality with a demonstration.
// Begin with a description or outline of the demonstration.
// Provide clear steps (in ordered lists) for the reader to follow.
// Typical demonstration flow is:
// 1. Prepare the environment for the demonstration.
//    This should be minimal, such as downloading some data to use.
//    If this requires more than a couple steps, consider putting it
//    in a subsection.
// 2. Perform the demonstration.
//    Be careful not to overuse screenshots.
// 3. Verify.
//    This may be interwoven into performing the demonstration.
//
// As with Installation, leverage ordered lists, code blocks,
// admonitions, and screenshots.
//

== Summary

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Summarize:
// - Motivation (1 sentence)
// - What was covered (1-2 sentences)
// - Next steps (unordered list of 2-4 further learning resources)
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
