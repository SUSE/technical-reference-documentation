Confidential computing focuses on enabling you to secure your data in use.
This is accomplished by performing computations in a hardware-based, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment[trusted execution environment].
This technology can be deployed in your data centers, in public and private clouds, and even at edge locations.
With confidential computing, your workload data is protected no matter where it is running.

SUSE and IBM work together to deliver advanced technical capabilities, like confidential computing.
IBM Z(R) and LinuxONE systems provide key hardware capabilities for the trusted execution environment.
{product2_url}[{product2_full}] ({product2}) is designed to deliver performance, security, reliability, and efficiency for your mission-critical workloads on IBM Z(R) and LinuxONE systems.

Container technologies enable enterprises to achieve unprecedented agility, resilience, and scale.
Enterprises still need to protect sensitive workload data.
Thus, leveraging confidential computing for containerized workloads is essential.

In this guide, you learn how to deploy a containerized confidential computing workload to an IBM Z(R) and LinuxONE trusted execution environment using a {product1_full} ({product1}) and the {hpp}.



// Confidential computing focuses on securing your data through technical assurance which guarantees that a cloud operator cannot access your data.
// Confidential computing can also be used within your data center or within the data center of a service provider to protect your data.
// Hardware capabilities within IBM Z(R) and LinuxONE systems provide the trusted execution environment that protects your data-in-use.
// The confidential computing workload is built on SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container images and deployed securely using the IBM Hyper Protect Platform.


=== Scope

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Specify what this guide covers in no more than 2 sentences.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =


In this guide you:

* learn about the {hpp} architecture for on-premises and cloud deployments

* prepare an on-premises or cloud environment for a confidential container workload

* build a confidential container workload with {product1_full}

* deploy the confidential container workload

* verify the confidential container workload


// deploy a containerized confidential computing workload to an IBM Z and LinuxOne trusted execution environment using a SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Image (SLE BCI) and the IBM Hyper Protect Platform.


=== Audience

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify for whom this document is intended, perhaps with:
//   - topics of interests (e.g., machine learning, security, etc.)

You are encouraged to start your journey with https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-se#about-hyper-protect-virtual-servers-for-vpc[Confidential computing with LinuxONE] using {hpvs_cloud} for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

The infrastructure for the trusted execution environment needed for HPVS is already set up and available as an easy-to-use service in IBM Cloud.
If you want to use {hpvs_cloud} for VPC, then all you need is an IBM Cloud https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-accounts#paygo[Pay-As-You-Go account].

On-premises confidential computing deployments use https://www.ibm.com/products/hyper-protect-virtual-servers[{hpvs_onprem}].
This is the same technology used in {hpvs_cloud} for VPC, but you will need to prepare the required infrastructure.
The following high level infrastructure prerequisites are needed to use {hpvs_onprem}:

* An IBM Z(R) or LinuxONE system
** IBM z16 (all models)
** IBM z15 (all models)
** IBM LinuxONE 4
** IBM LinuxONE III

* Feature Code 115 Secure Execution for Linux

* Logical partition (LPAR) running {product2_full} {product2_version}
//
+
{product2} will provide the IBM Secure Execution enabled Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) host.

* {hpvs_full} {hpvs_onprem_ver}
//
+
A https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hpvs/2.1.x?topic=trial-program[trial program] for {hpvs_full} and Crypto Express Network API for Secure Execution Enclaves is available from IBM.
+
//
Detailed system requirements can be found in the https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hpvs/2.1.x?topic=servers-system-requirements[{hpvs_onprem} {hpvs_onprem_ver} documentation].

[NOTE]
====
This guide was developed with the noted software versions.
You are encouraged to use the latest releases to take advantage of various updates and security patches.

== Technical overview

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a technical overview of the solution.
// - Identify components.
// - Describe how the components fit together.
//   Leverage diagrams as appropriate, including (but not limited to):
//   - component architecture
//   - data flow diagram
//   - workflow diagram
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =


image::hpvs-architecture.svg[IBM Hyper Protect Platform architecture, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

The https://www.ibm.com/downloads/cas/GPVMWPM3[{hpp}] architecture is illustrated in this diagram at a high level.
On the left are the components that comprise the confidential computing environment in IBM Cloud, on the right are those for on-premises or hosted datacenter scenarios.
The architectural similarities facilitate a hybrid deployment model that gives you the flexibility to easily target the location of your workload depending on business requirements.

The components of the {hpp} include:

* https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=virtualization-introducing-secure-execution-linux[Secure Execution for Linux]
//
+
This z/Architecture(R) security technology is introduced with IBM z15™ and LinuxONE III.
//
+
With Secure Execution for Linux, no hardware administrator, KVM code, or KVM administrator can access the data in a KVM virtual machine that was started as an IBM Secure Execution guest.

* https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.4.0?topic=configuration-logical-partitions[Logical partition] (LPAR)
//
+
Multiple LPARs can share the resources of a single, physical system.
//
+
The KVM host runs in an LPAR, which, in practice, is equivalent to an independent server running its own operating system.
+
[NOTE]
====
* {hpvs} for VPC use an IBM provided KVM host.
* {product2_full} can be used for on-premises and hosted data center deployments as a supported KVM host for {hpvs_onprem} {hpvs_onprem_ver}.
====

* KVM virtual machine
//
+
A KVM virtual machine can be started as a Secure Execution guest where memory protection is enforced, preventing unauthorized access to in-memory data.
//
+
Multiple KVM virtual machines can be started as Secure Execution guests.
If not started as a Secure Execution guest, the virtual machine memory protection is not enforced.

* IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime (HPCR)
//
+
The IBM Hyper Protect Container Runtime (HPCR) provides the environment for containers to be started and run confidentially.
The HPCR is a KVM virtual machine QCOW2 disk image file specifically built to start as a Secure Execution guest.
The HPCR requires input from a contract to pull and start containerized workloads from a customer or ISV provided container registry.
+
[NOTE]
====
* The HPCR virtual machine protects data-at-rest by encrypting the root disk and a separate data disk for container workload persistent storage.

* HPCR requires a contract, which is a definition of the workload configuration in YAML format.
The HPCR virtual machine will immediately stop when a contract is missing or invalid.
The contract is critical and is presented in more detail later in this document.
====

* Container images
//
+
Workload container images can be built on {product1_full} ({product1}).
//
+
You can run multiple workload containers on a single HPCR Secure Execution guest.

* Logging service
//
+
A logging service is required.
The HPCR virtual machine will immediately stop if logging is not defined in the contract.

A networking choice should be considered at this time.

The https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=recommendations-kvm-host-networking-configuration-choices[KVM Host Networking Configuration Choices] in the IBM documentation provides a detailed list of networking choices and pros and cons.

* Using a Linux bridge with NAT for KVM guests
* Using a Linux bridge (without NAT) for KVM guests
* Using an Open vSwitch bridge with KVM guests
* Using the MacVTap driver with KVM guests

Confirm prerequisites like https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=choices-osa-interface-traffic-forwarding[OSA interface traffic forwarding] are met for your choice of networking.

This getting started guide will use the https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/linux-on-systems?topic=choices-using-macvtap-driver[MacVTap driver] in Bridge mode with the `eth0` interface.  
No prerequisites are required using MacVTap but it is important to review the `MacVTap isolation / limitations` section.

An external DHCP server is required to provide networking information for the VMs using MacVTAP.

.. Append `prot_virt=1` to `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` in `/etc/default/grub`.
+
The following is an example of the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` line with `prot_virt=1` appended.
+
[listing]
----
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="hvc_iucv=8 TERM=dumb mitigations=auto security=apparmor cio_ignore=all,!ipldev,!condev prot_virt=1"       
----

.. Recreate `grub.cfg`.
+
[source, console]
----
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
----

.. Reboot.

. Verify IBM Secure Execution is enabled with `virt-host-validate`.
+
Verify the line has `PASS` in the output.
+
[source, console]
----
  QEMU: Checking for secure guest support                                    : PASS
----

==== Downloading the HPCR image

. Make a directory on the KVM host to store the HPCR image.
+
[source, console]
----
mkdir /opt/hpvs-hpcr
----

. Download the latest version of the HPCR image from https://www-01.ibm.com/software/passportadvantage/pao_customer.html[IBM Passport Advantage] to the directory created in the previous step.
+
[NOTE]
====
Verify if an IBM HPCR fix pack is available from https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral[IBM Fix Central].
====

. Verify the integrity and decompress the download following steps 5 - 6 of the https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hpvs/2.1.x?topic=servers-downloading-hyper-protect-container-runtime-image#procedure[procedure].

. Make a note of location and file name of `qcow2` HPCR image[[note-hpcr-image-location]].
For example, _ibm-hyper-protect-container-runtime-23.3.0.qcow2_ is the file name which is located in the _/opt/hpvs-hpcr/IBM-HPVS-OnPrem-v2.1.4-EN-Trial/images_.

==== Setting up an `rsyslog` logging service for HPVS log information

With the release of SLES 15 SP5, Minimal VM images for IBM Z and LinuxONE systems can be downloaded from https://www.suse.com/download/sles/[suse.com].
Two KVM `qcow2` image file options are available - kvm and Cloud.
The file name of the `qcow2` image files will include either _kvm_ or _Cloud_ for differentiation.

* The _kvm_ image file will prompt during firstboot for information to customize items like host name and networking information.
* The _Cloud_ image file uses cloud-init to customize the host name and networking information.

You can choose to manually install SLES with the installation media or use a pre-built SLES image file from SUSE.

[NOTE]
====
This guide will provide the steps to use the _Cloud_ image to deploy an `rsyslog` kvm virtual machine on the same KVM host where the confidential computing workload will be run.
====

. Make a directory to store the disk image and other files for the `rsyslog` VM.
+
[source, console]
----
mkdir /var/lib/libvirt/images/rsyslog
----

. Download the _SLES 15 SP5 Minimal VM Cloud qcow2_ image file at https://www.suse.com/download/sles/[suse.com].
Place the file in the _/var/lib/libvirt/images/rsyslog_ directory.
Name the file _rsyslog.qcow2_.

. Create the following required cloud-init files.

.. _vi /var/lib/libvirt/images/rsyslog/meta-data_
+
[source, console]
----
local-hostname: rsyslog
----

.. _vi /var/lib/libvirt/images/rsyslog/user-data_
+
[source, console]
----
#cloud-config
ssh_authorized_keys:
  - <public ssh key 1>
  - <public ssh key 2>
----
+
=> where <public ssh key 1> and if needed <public ssh key 2> will be added to the _authorized_keys_ file for the `sles` user. +
+
[NOTE]
====
This configuration requires an external DHCP server to provide the static networking information to the `rsyslog` server based on MAC address.
Additional cloud examples for networking and other configurations can be found at the following resources:

* https://documentation.suse.com/pt-br/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/article-minimal-vm.html#sec-cloud-init-config-examples[cloud-init configuration examples]
* https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:MicroOS/cloud-init[Configuration with cloud-init]
* https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/examples.html#cloud-config-examples[Cloud config examples]
====

. Generate a MAC address for the `rsyslog` VM.

.. Create the `/root/bin/macgen.py` python script.
+
[source, console]
----
#!/usr/bin/python3
# macgen.py script to generate a MAC address for guests on KVM
 
import random
 
def randomMAC():
    mac = [ 0x52, 0x54, 0x00,
    random.randint(0x00, 0x7f),
    random.randint(0x00, 0xff),
    random.randint(0x00, 0xff) ]
    return ':'.join(map(lambda x: "%02x" % x, mac))
 
print(randomMAC())
----

.. Make the `macgen.py` script executable.
+
[source, console]
----
chmod +x /root/bin/macgen.py
----

.. Run `macgen.py` and note the output.
Here is an example when run.
+
[source, console]
----
# macgen.py 
52:54:00:5b:15:df
----

. Use the generated MAC address to define a host entry with a static IP address in your DHCP server.

. Define and start the `rsyslog` VM with the following command.
+
[source, console]
----

== Building, publishing, and defining

In this section you prepare a workload container image, publish the container image to a registry, and define the IBM Hyper Protect Services contract that will be used during deployment.
The steps in this section are the same for cloud and on-premises deployments.

You will use the https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-financial-transaction-confidential-computing-on-hyper-protect-virtual-server-for-vpc[PayNow Node.js application], which has been already built on a SLE BCI container image and published to a container registry.
The steps are also available if you want to build the PayNow Node.js application on a SLE BCI container.

See https://mediacenter.ibm.com/media/Confidential+Computing+for+a+financial+transaction+using+Hyper+Protect+Virtual+Server+for+VPC/1_vv3j2oo6[confidential computing in action].
In this demonstration, the PayNow Node.js application shows a financial transaction running without confidential computing and with confidential computing.

=== Building a container image

Building one or more application container images is a necessary step.
The PayNow Node.js application container image has already been built on a SLE BCI container and published to a container registry.
You can go to <<Defining the contract>> to use the PayNow Node.js application container image or follow the steps below to build your own image of the PayNow Node.js application.

Access to a Linux on s390x instance is required to build the PayNow Node.js application container image.
These steps will use `git` and `podman` to build and publish the OCI-compliant PayNow Node.js application container image.
An option is to use an IBM Cloud virtual server instance (VSI) for VPC with a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vsabout-images#vs-s390x-supported-os[s390x stock virtual server image] but any Linux distro on s390x with `git` and `podman` is sufficient.

The https://registry.suse.com/categories/bci-lang[SLE BCI Language Container Images] for Node.js development is used as base for the PayNow Node.js application container image.

. Clone the Pay Now Web site sources.
+
[source, console]
----
git clone https://github.com/mfriesenegger/paynow-website.git
cd paynow-website
git checkout slebci-paynow-website
----

. Build the PayNow Node.js application container image.
+
[source, console]
----
podman build -f ./Dockerfile -t slebci-paynow-website
----

. Start the *Verify the PayNow Node.js* application container.
+
[source, console]
----
podman run -d --rm --name paynow-website -p 8443:8443 \

=== Publishing the container image to a registry

Publishing one or more application container images is a necessary step.
The PayNow Node.js application container image has already been built on a SLE BCI container and published to a container registry.
You can go to <<Defining the contract>> to use the PayNow Node.js application container image or follow the steps below to publish your own image of the PayNow Node.js application.

Access to the same Linux on s390x instance that built the PayNow Node.js application container image is required to publish the image.
These steps will use `podman` to publish the OCI-compliant PayNow Node.js application container image.
A properly configured GitHub account is required to publish the image to your https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry[GitHub Container registry].

. Tag the PayNow Node.js application container image to your GitHub account.
+
[source, console]
----
podman tag localhost/slebci-paynow-website:latest \

== Deployment

The deployment steps differ, depending on whether you are deploying to cloud or to your on-premises environment.
Proceed to either <<Cloud deployment>> or <<On-premises deployment>>.


=== Cloud deployment

For this guide, you use the IBM Cloud Web Console to perform the deployment.
It is also possible to perform a deployment using the IBM Cloud CLI or Terraform.


==== Deploying the workload

Follow these steps to deploy your confidential container workload on IBM Cloud Hyper Protect Virtual Servers for VPC.

. Return to the https://cloud.ibm.com/ Web browser window or tab where you created the VPC.

. Select __Navigation Menu__ > __VPC Infrastructure__ > __Virtual server instances__.

. Confirm that the correct Region is selected.

. Click __Create__.

. Edit the following in __Virtual server for VPC__:

.. Change __Architecture__ to `IBM Z, LinuxONE`.

.. Use the slider under __Confidential computing__ to enable `Run your workload with an OS and a profile protected by Secure Execution`.

.. Verify that the __Zone__ in __Location__ matches the location (zone) within the region that you noted earlier.

.. Set the __Name__ of the instance to `slebci-paynow-website`.

.. Click __Import user data__ in __User data (optional)__ to select `slebci-paynow-website-contract.yml` from the local system.

.. Click __Create virtual server__.

. Select __Network__ > __Floating IPs__ and complete the following:

.. Click __Actions...__ to the right of the `myvpc-paynow-floatip` entry.

.. Select __Bind__.

.. Select `slebci-paynow-website` in __Resource to bind__.

.. Click __Bind__.

. Select __Compute__ > __Virtual server instances__ and complete the following:

.. Click __Actions...__ to the right of the `slebci-paynow-website` entry.

.. Select __Open serial console__.

.. Watch for the following within the serial console as the instance is being started:
+
[source, console]
----
VSI has started successfully.
----


=== On-premises deployment

An on-premises deployment will prepared and started via the CLI on the KVM host.

==== Deploying the workload

. Make a directory to store the disk image and other files for the HPCR.
+
[source, console]
----
mkdir /var/lib/libvirt/images/slebci-paynow-website
----

. Copy the HPCR image file from the location noted in a previous step <<note-hpcr-image-location>> to _/var/lib/libvirt/images/slebci-paynow-website_.

. Create the cloud configuration files and init-disk ISO.

.. Create the _meta-data_ file in the directory created above.
//
+
For example:
+
[source, console]
----
vi /var/lib/libvirt/images/slebci-paynow-website/meta-data
----
+
Add the following line to the file:
+
[listing]
----
local-hostname: slebci-paynow-website
----

.. Create the _vendor-data_ file in the same directory.
+
For example:
+
[source, console]
----
vi /var/lib/libvirt/images/slebci-paynow-website/vendor-data
----
+
Add the following contents to the _vendor-data_ file:
+
[listing]
----
#cloud-config
users:
- default
----

.. Copy the _slebci-paynow-website-contract.yml_ contract file from the local system to the _/var/lib/libvirt/images/slebci-paynow-website/user-data_ file on the KVM host.

.. Create the `init-disk` ISO image.
+
[source, console]
----
mkisofs \
  -output /var/lib/libvirt/images/slebci-paynow-website/init-disk \
  -volid cidata -joliet -rock \
  /var/lib/libvirt/images/slebci-paynow-website/user-data \
  /var/lib/libvirt/images/slebci-paynow-website/meta-data \
  /var/lib/libvirt/images/slebci-paynow-website/vendor-data
----

. Generate a MAC address for the HPCR VM with `macgen.py`.
+
[source, console]
----
macgen.py
----
+
You should see something like:
+
[listing]
----
# macgen.py 
52:54:00:02:77:72
----

. Use the generated MAC address to define a host entry with a static IP address in your DHCP server.

. Define and start the `slebci-paynow-website` VM.
+
[source, console]
----
virt-install \
  --name=slebci-paynow-website \
  --osinfo ubuntu20.04 \
  --memory=3815 \
  --vcpus vcpu.placement=static,vcpus=2 \

----
+
=> where `<macaddress>` in this command is replaced with the MAC address you noted in the previous step.

. The VM console will be displayed and the HPCR VM will boot.
//
+
Watch for the following in the console as the instance is being started:
+
[listing]
----
VSI has started successfully.
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Press `Ctrl + ]` keys to disconnect from the VM console.

=== Verifying the workload is running

==== Accessing the PayNow application via its Web UI

. Open a new Web browser window or tab.

. Enter `\https://<ip address>:8443`, where `<ip address>` is one of the following:
+
--
* the floating IP address noted earlier for the VPC deployment in IBM Cloud.

* the IP address assigned to the HPCR VM running on the KVM host.

[NOTE]
====
Your Web browser may display a warning about an insecure connection and an invalid certificate because the application uses a self-signed certificate.
====
--

. You should see that the PayNow application is running.
+
image::paynow-website.png[PayNow UI, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

. Click the __PayNow__ button.

. Enter example personally identifiable information (PII) and credit card information.


==== Reviewing the logs

. Access the log information.
+
* Use the following to review the logs of the {hpvs_cloud} for VPC instance.

.. Return to the https://cloud.ibm.com/ window or tab where you created the logging service.
+
.. Verify that log information is displayed.
+
* Use the following to review the logs of the on-premises {hpvs_onprem} Container Runtime VM.
+
.. Log in to the `rsyslog` server with `ssh`.
+
.. Display the log file on the command line.
+
[source, console]
----
less /var/log/hpcr.log

== Managing workloads

This section focuses on steps in the <<Workflow>> that introduce additional ways to interact with the confidential containized workload.

=== Enabling and verifying attestation

The {hpp} container runtime generates attestation data as it starts.
The attestation data creation process is the same in https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-attestation[IBM Cloud] and https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/hpvs/2.1.x?topic=servers-attestation[on-premises] storing several attestation-related files in _/var/hyperprotect_ on the container runtime.
The attestation record (also called https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-attestation#attestation_doc[attestation document]) contains checksums, which are used to verify the integrity of the environment where a workload starts.

The recommended method to access the attestation document is via the workload.
The https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-financial-transaction-confidential-computing-on-hyper-protect-virtual-server-for-vpc[PayNow Node.js application] application developers added API calls that provide an https://github.com/ibm-hyper-protect/paynow-website/blob/main/app/app.js#L42[encrypted] or an https://github.com/ibm-hyper-protect/paynow-website/blob/main/app/app.js#L47[unencrypted] attestation document.

Follow the steps below to access the encrypted attestation document and verify the attestation data of a deployed PayNow Node.js application.

. Enable the workload to access the attestation data.

.. Add `volumes` section to your Docker Compose file.
//
+
For example, if you are using the pre-built PayNow Node.js application container image, update your `docker-compose.yml` as follows:
+
[source, yaml]
----
services:
  paynow:
    image: ghcr.io/mfriesenegger/slebci-paynow-website@sha256:ecb229f68aef81ca4a2b7b5a9eb192081fa2a170e44d9e5a28180bb12682ce5d
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
      - "8443:8443"
    volumes:
      - "/var/hyperprotect/:/var/hyperprotect/:ro"
----

.. Recreate the base64 encoded TAR archive.

.. Update the `archive` item in the workload contract with the new base64 data.

. Use a private/public key pair for attestation document encryption.

.. In the directory where the Docker Compose file exists, the following commands will create the private/public key pair for attestation encryption.
+
[source, console]
----
openssl genpkey -aes256 -algorithm RSA -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048 \
-out attest-private-key.pem
openssl pkey -in attest-private-key.pem -out attest-public-key.pem -pubout
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You will be asked to define a passphrase when creating the private key and to provide the same passphrase when creating public portion of the key. 
====

.. Add `attestationPublicKey` to the contract file (the relevant portion is shown below).
+
[source, yaml]
----
workload: |
  type: workload
  compose:
    archive: H4sIAAAAAAAAA+3UzW7bMAwHcJ/zFELucahP2gYG7LjjXkG2mNRoXQdWtrZvP6XBsCyHboeuW7H/ 
attestationPublicKey: <attest-pubkey>
----
+
=> where the output of the following command replaces `<attest-pubkey>`.
+
[source, console]
----
IFS=$'\n'; echo -n \"; for line in $(cat attest-public-key.pem);\
 do echo -n $line"\n"; done; echo \"
----

. Deploy the workload either in IBM Cloud or on-premises.

. Open your Web browser to `\https://<ip address>:8443//api/v1/attestation` to access the encrypted attestation document.
//
+
Replace `<ip address>` with the floating IP address noted earlier for the VPC deployment in IBM Cloud or the IP address assigned to the HPCR VM running on the KVM host.

. Save the encrypted attestation document to _se-checksums.txt.enc_.
//
+
The file can be saved on the local system where the Docker Compose file is located.

. Use the following script to decrypt the encrypted attestation document.
+
[source, bash]
----
#!/bin/bash
#
# Example script to decrypt attestation document.
#
# Usage:
#   ./decrypt-attestation.sh <rsa-priv-key.pem> [file]
#
# Token Format:
#   hyper-protect-basic.<ENC_AES_KEY_BASE64>.<ENC_MESSAGE_BASE64>


RSA_PRIV_KEY="$1"
if [ -z "$RSA_PRIV_KEY" ]; then
    echo "Usage: $0 <rsa-priv-key.pem>"
    exit 1
fi
INPUT_FILE="${2:-se-checksums.txt.enc}"
TMP_DIR="$(mktemp -d)"
#trap 'rm -r $TMP_DIR' EXIT


PASSWORD_ENC="${TMP_DIR}/password_enc"
MESSAGE_ENC="${TMP_DIR}/message_enc"


# extract encrypted AES key and encrypted message
cut -d. -f 2 "$INPUT_FILE"| base64 -d > "$PASSWORD_ENC"
cut -d. -f 3 "$INPUT_FILE"| base64 -d > "$MESSAGE_ENC"

# decrypt password
PASSWORD=$(openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey "$RSA_PRIV_KEY" -in "$PASSWORD_ENC")

# decrypt message
echo -n "$PASSWORD" | openssl aes-256-cbc -d -pbkdf2 -in "$MESSAGE_ENC" -pass stdin --out se-checksums.txt
----

. Verify the integrity of workload contract.

..  Generate an SHA256 checksum of the local contract file.
+
[source, console]
----
sha256sum slebci-paynow-website-contract.yml
----

.. Compare the output of the above command with the `user-data` line in the _se-checksums.txt_ attestation document.
//
+
If the checksums match, then the contract used to start the workload is same as its source.
+
[TIP]
====
A similar verification process can be done for the other items listed in the attestation document.
