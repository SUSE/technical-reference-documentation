== Introduction

=== Motivation

Modern software development is largely agile, open, and collaborative.

Nowhere has this been more obvious and impactful than in the domain of machine learning (ML), where the development community comes from a broad spectrum of domains and backgrounds.
This has resulted in a rapid state of continuous development, evolving a wealthy ecosystem of software that enable developers to make huge advances and push the limits of hardware to solve previously intractable problems in record time.
But rapid development can lead to dependency conflicts, where two applications or two components of the same application rely on different versions of the same library.

Today, developers have access to container technologies that help overcome this challenge.
Containers provide a convenient, lightweight way to package your application components with their dependencies while isolating these from other components and their dependencies.
Containers also enable massive scale, letting you run your applications everywhere they are needed - in the data center, in the cloud, and at the edge.


=== Scope

This document illustrates how to take the first steps with containers to support ML development and implementation.


=== Audience

This document is intended for data scientists, ML developers, operations teams, systems architects and others interested in learning more about container technologies.
To progress with this document, the reader should have basic Linux command line skills and some knowledge of containers.


== Overview

=== Goals

In this guide, you learn how to:

* set up https://podman.io[Podman] on https://www.suse.com/products/server/[{productname}].

* specify and build a container image for a https://jupyter.org/[JupyterLab] ML development environment.

* run your container and access the ML development environment.


=== Software ecosystem

. https://www.suse.com/products/server/[{productname}]
//
+
This guide leverages {productname} (SLE) as a host operating system for building and running containers.
SLE can be run on bare metal or in virtual machines to provide a stable, supportable Linux environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
Most of the steps outlined in this guide are directly transferable to https://www.opensuse.org/#Leap[{opensuse}].
====

. https://www.suse.com/products/base-container-images/[SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Images (SLE BCI)]
//
+
A base container image provides basic functionality, such as a stripped-down Linux operating system.
It is onto a base container image that you layer your application components.
SUSE base container images are freely available, re-distributable, supported across many environments.
These images are designed to be a secure, flexible foundation for any containerized workload, including ML applications, that need to be deployed anywhere - in the data center, in the cloud, and on edge devices.
+
[TIP]
====
SUSE maintains up-to-date, ready-to-use container images at https://registry.suse.com/[registry.suse.com].
====

. https://podman.io[Podman]
//
+
Podman, which is short for Pod Manager, is a daemonless, open source tool for finding, building, managing, and running https://opencontainers.org/[Open Container Initiative] (OCI) containers on Linux systems.
Podman is similar to other container engines, such as *Docker*, *CRI-O*, and *containerd*. It relies on an OCI compliant container runtime (like _runc_, _crun_, _runv_, etc.) to interface with the operating system for creating the running containers.
This means that running Podman containers is nearly indistinguishable from running those created by other common container engines.
You can also run Podman containers as an ordinary, non-privileged user, making it easier and more secure.
See the https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/single-html/SLES-container/[SUSE Container Guide] for a deeper discussion on containers and Podman.


. https://www.python.org/[Python]
//
+
Python has become a popular programming ecosystem for ML developers for its simplicity, elegance, extensibility, cross-platform availability, and active, open source community of developers and users.
With Python, ML developers have access to a vast collection of libraries, frameworks, and toolkits with which to build solutions to complex problems.


. https://jupyter.org/[JupyterLab]
//
+
JupyterLab is a modular, interactive development environment with a Web interface that enables data scientists and developers to create and share computational documents, called notebooks.
+

+
[TIP]
====
See https://documentation.suse.com/trd/linux/single-html/gs_sles_jupyter-jupyterlab/[Replicable Python Environments with JupyterLab and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server] for more details about working with Python and JupyterLab on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.
====


== Enable Podman

Podman is not installed by default in {productname}.
So, your first step is to install it.


=== Install Podman

. Enable SUSE Containers Module.
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.4/x86_64
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The Containers Module is a free add-on module for your SUSE Linux Enterprise Server system.
====

. Install Podman.
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo zypper in podman
----
+
[TIP]
====
It is a good idea to make sure your system is up-to-date with security patches and updates prior to installing new software.
You can do this with the command:
[source, bash]
----
sudo zypper up
----
====


=== Configure Podman to run without root privileges

Podman can be run as an ordinary user, but you may need to make a few configuration changes.
To keep this simple, you will grant your current user, `$USER`, this access.

. Define subUID and subGID ranges for your current user.
//
+
You need to define a range of UIDs and GIDs that will be allocated to users inside the container and mapped onto the host.
You can check the _/etc/subuid_ and _/etc/subgid_ files to see if these ranges are already defined for your user.
//
+
If they are not, issue the command:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo usermod --add-subuids 100000-165535 --add-subgids 100000-165535 ${USER}
----
+
[WARNING]
====
The subUID and subGID ranges ('100000-165535' in the command example) must not overlap for different users and not reuse UIDs and GIDs of existing users on the host.
====

. Ensure your current user has permissions to access Zypper credentials on the host.
The container may need access to read the SUSE Customer Center credentials, located in _/etc/zypp/credentials.d_.
//
+
Grant permission to the user with:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo setfacl -m u:${USER}:r /etc/zypp/credentials.d/*
----


=== Verify the container storage driver

It is important to consider where and how your containers and container images are stored.
System container storage settings are defined in _/etc/containers/storage.conf_.
Storage settings can be overridden for a particular user by options placed in _$HOME/.config/containers/storage.conf_ or with appropriate environment variables.

The default location Podman uses for container data is _/var/lib/containers/storage_.
This is defined by the 'graphroot' option in _/etc/containers/storage.conf_ and only applies to the root user.

For ordinary users, Podman defaults to _$HOME/.local/share/containers/storage_.
It can be useful to change this location, such as when user home directories are remotely mounted NFS shares.
This behavior can be changed for all users by setting 'rootless_storage_path' in the '[storage]' section of _/etc/containers/storage.conf_.

How container data are written is determined by the storage driver.
This is defined by the 'driver' setting in the '[storage]' section of _/etc/containers/storage.conf_.
For the root user, valid drivers include 'overlay2', 'vfs', 'zfs', and 'btrfs'.

[NOTE]
====
The 'btrfs' driver is the default for {productname}, since https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs[Btrfs] is the default file system for system volumes.
Btrfs offers many advantages over earlier file systems, such as copy-on-write, pooling, snapshots, and checksums.
====

If your home directory is in a partition formatted with a different file system, Podman will default to the 'overlay2' or 'vfs' driver and warn you to set an appropriate storage driver.
Usually this will be the 'overlay2' driver.
You can set this without administrator help by creating the file _$HOME/.config/containers/storage.conf_ with the following content:

[listing]
----
[storage]
driver = "overlay2"
----

[TIP]
====
See the manual page for containers-storage.conf for more storage settings:
`man containers-storage.conf 5`
====


== Create your application container image

An application container image is built by adding the application with the libraries and the other software it needs to run (its dependencies) as layers on top of a https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/single-html/SLES-container/#cha-bci[base container image].
In this section, you create a container image for the JupyterLab Python development environment along with some useful Python packages.


=== Make a build directory

You need a place in your file system to contain the files you will use for building your container image.
Your build directory can be located anywhere you have write access, such as a directory under your home directory.

Create your build directory and change to it.

For example,

[source, bash]
----
mkdir $HOME/jupcontainer
cd $HOME/jupcontainer
----




=== Define the Python environment

Replicability is critical in science and engineering.
Complex applications, like an ML model, can produce wildly different results or not work at all because of minor code variations in a library dependency.
So, it becomes important when building such applications to explicitly define all the software dependencies and their versions.

Fortunately, it is quite easy to create https://documentation.suse.com/trd/linux/single-html/gs_sles_jupyter-jupyterlab/[replicable Python environments].
Key to this process are the `pip` Python package management tool and a file that lists the required packages and their versions, typically named _requirements.txt_.

[NOTE]
====
Each package you specify may have several dependencies of its own.
Depending on your needs, your _requirements.txt_ file can become quite long.
However, in practice, you only need to specify the main packages used for your application, and the `pip` dependency resolver will automatically install the right dependencies to enable your application.
====

Create this _requirements.txt_ file in your build directory:

[listing]
----
numpy==1.19.5
pandas==1.1.5
scikit-learn==0.24.2
scipy==1.5.4
seaborn==0.11.2
matplotlib==3.3.4
jupyterlab==3.2.9
----

In this example, you specify the exact version of each package.
If the specified version of a package is not available, your container image build will fail.
One way to overcome this is to remove the version specification (for example, specify `seaborn` instead of `seaborn==0.11.2`).
This frees the `pip` dependency resolver to substitute in an appropriate, available version of the package.

[TIP]
====
You can automatically create a _requirements.txt_ file from an installed environment by issuing `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
This will include all installed packages, except `pip` itself and its dependencies.
====


=== Define the container image

The `podman build` command can build a container image from a sequence of instructions provided in a https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/Containerfile.5.md[Containerfile].
If you are familiar with the Docker container ecosystem, a Containerfile shares the same format and most of the same options as a Dockerfile.


Create a file, named _Containerfile_, in your build directory with the following contents:

[listing]
----
# jupyterlab Containerfile

# https://registry.suse.com/
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest

# set notebook directory
ENV JUPYTER="/home/jupyter"

# make Zypper run without user prompts
ENV ZYPPERCMD="zypper --non-interactive"

# install developer tools
RUN $ZYPPERCMD install gcc gcc-fortran
RUN $ZYPPERCMD install python3 python3-pip
RUN $ZYPPERCMD install python3-devel

# create notebook directory and make it the working directory
RUN mkdir -p $JUPYTER/notebooks
WORKDIR $JUPYTER
RUN cd $JUPYTER
RUN pwd

# copy requirements file into working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

# install required Python components
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# expose JupyterLab web port
EXPOSE 8888/tcp

# launch JupyterLab with a few options
CMD jupyter lab --ip=* --port=8888 --no-browser --notebook-dir=$JUPYTER/notebooks --allow-root
----

The instructions used in this _Containerfile_ to automate the build of your container are:

* `CMD` provides a default command to be executed when running the container.

* `COPY` copies files into the container.

* `EXPOSE` informs the container engine that the container listens on the specified network ports.

* `ENV` sets an environment variable.

* `FROM` specifies which base layer to use.

* `RUN` executes a command in a shell (`/bin/sh -c`).

* `WORKDIR` sets the working directory for `RUN`, `CMD`, `COPY` and other instructions.


An important consideration for your container build is the base layer.
You can obtain base layer container images from a variety of sources, including the https://registry.suse.com/[SUSE container registry].

For this guide, you use the 'latest' SUSE Linux Enterprise base container image, which, at the time of this writing, is built on {productname}.
SUSE also provides base container images with specific development languages already installed, which can speed up your build process.

When choosing a base container image, keep in mind the following considerations:

Security::
Is the image from and signed by a trusted source, verifiable, and up-to-date with vulnerability fixes?

Reliability::
Is the image based on an operating system with a reputation for reliability and has the image undergone quality assurance testing?

Integration::
Are you able to use the image with your preferred software, tooling, and workflows?

Redistribution::
Are you legally able to redistribute the custom application container images you build on it?

Learn more about https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/html/SLES-container/cha-bci.html[why SUSE Linux Enterprise base container images] offer the ideal foundation for your application containers.



=== Build the container image

At this point, you have:

* a _Containerfile_ to specify how to build the container

* a _requirements.txt_ file to specify the Python packages you want

Now, you can build your container image with `podman build`.


. Make sure you are in your build directory.

. Build the container image.
+
[source, bash]
----
podman build --tag jupyter .
----
+
[TIP]
====
By using the `--tag jupyter` or `-t jupyter` option, your container will be nameed _localhost/jupyter_.
====

. Verify your container image exists.
+
[source, bash]
----
podman image list
----
The output of this command looks something like:
+
[source, bash]
----
REPOSITORY                      TAG         IMAGE ID      CREATED         SIZE
localhost/jupyter               latest      d8bbefc6be69  11 minutes ago  837 MB
registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base  latest      35ebb6a7981e  4 days ago      125 MB
----
You should see your container image, _localhost/jupyter_.
+
[TIP]
====
You can also list images with the command `podman images`.
Learn more about Podman commands at https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Commands.html.
====


== Run your application container

You have most likely heard of containers as a technology to implement microservices architectures, where software applications are composed of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined application programming interfaces (APIs).
JupyterLab is not a microservice, so it is an unusual application to put into a container.
However, containerizing JupyterLab with required libraries to execute a particular Jupyter notebook, can be a useful way to share a fully replicable experiment.


. Prepare a shared workspace.

.. Create and enter your working directory.
+
[source, bash]
----
mkdir $HOME/mynotebooks
cd $HOME/mynotebooks
----

.. Add one or more files (such as Jupyter notebooks) to your working directory.
//
+
If you do not have your own Jupyter notebook to use, you can find a plethora to download from the Web, 
including Alexis Cook's https://www.kaggle.com/code/alexisbcook/titanic-tutorial/notebook[Titanic Tutorial] for https://kaggle.com/[Kaggle].


. Launch your JupyterLab container.
+
[source, bash]
----
podman run --name jupyter \
 -p 8888:8888 \
 -v $(pwd):/home/jupyter/notebooks \
 localhost/jupyter
----
+
====
In this command, you specify the following options:

* `--name` to set a name for the container.

* `-p` or `--publish` to publish a container's network port or range of ports to the host.

* `-v` or `--volume` to create a bind mount of a directory on your host to one in your container.
====
//
+
Note the output in your terminal, where you will see the URL and access token for the containerized JupyterLab environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
    To access the server, open this file in a browser:
        file:///root/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-1-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://95038cde3755:8888/lab?token=77810fba9aec755d0a289a38cf2152bc3e1bf9b927082f30
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=77810fba9aec755d0a289a38cf2152bc3e1bf9b927082f30
----

. Access JupyterLab.
//
+
Open the Web browser on your host system to the last URL shown in your terminal (the one that begins with 'http://127.0.0.1').
If all went well, you are presented with the main JupyterLab user interface (UI).
+
image::jupyterlab-podman-ui.png[JupyterLab UI, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Verify you can access an existing file.
//
+
Your shared files are listed in the left pane of the UI.
Double-click a file name to open the file in a tab in the main pane.
+
image::jupyterlab-podman-titanic.png[JupyterLab Titanic notebook example, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Verify you can create a new notebook.

.. In the JupyterLab UI __Launcher__ tab, click __Python 3__ under __Notebook__.

.. Add some content to the new notebook.
+
image::jupyterlab-podman-notebook.png[JupyterLab notebook example, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]
+
[TIP]
====
See the  https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebook.html[Jupyter notebooks user documentation] to learn about cell types, computational kernels, basic usage, and more.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
Notebooks default to _untitled.ipynb_.
You can rename your notebook with __File__ > __Rename Notebook__ or by right-clicking the file in the file listing and selecting __Rename__.
====

.. Verify file ownership.
//
+
On your host computer, open a terminal, change to your working directory, and list the contents.
+
[source, bash]
----
ls -l
----
This produces output similar to the following:
+
[source, bash]
----
total 328
-rw-r--r-- 1 jane users   1586 Nov  9 15:44 test1.ipynb
-rw-r--r-- 1 jane users 328257 Nov  9 15:32 titanic-machine-learning.ipynb
----
+
where you should see your user and group associated with the new Jupyter notebook.

. Shut down JupyterLab.

.. Save and close any open Jupyter notebooks.

.. Select __File__ > __Shutdown__ in the JupyterLab UI.
//
+
Then, confirm that you want to shut down JupyterLab.
//
+
In the terminal you used to launch your container, you will see messages from JupyterLab that it is shutting down before you are returned to the command prompt.
+
[TIP]
====
You can also quickly shut down JupyterLab and exit your container by issuing CTRL-C in the terminal where you started it.
====

[NOTE]
====
Exiting a container does not delete the container.
It still exists and can be stopped and restarted again and again.
//
To see all containers on your system (including the stopped ones), use `podman container list --all`.
====


== Manage your containers

In this guide, you used `podman build` to create a container image and `podman run` to instantiate the image as a container.
Podman provides many https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Commands.html[commands] to help you manage your containers and container images.

Explore Podman commands in https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.3/html/SLE-Micro-all/article-podman.html#sec-working-containers[Podman Guide: Working with containers].


== Summary

Modern application development eschews closed, monolithic structures in favor of open, interoperable, microservices architectures designed and implemented with containers.
Container technologies support Modern Agile software development. They enable operations teams to manage the full lifecycle of complex application landscapes across a broad spectrum of infrastructure and services - in the data center, in the cloud, and at the edge.
Innovation across many domains, including machine learning, have been accelerated by the availability of container technologies that make it easier to collaborate, test, and deploy new capabilities.

//

In this guide, you took first steps working with containers.
You learned how to install Podman, then use it to build, deploy, and manage an application container.
You also learned how to use SUSE Linux Enterprise base container images, which provide a reliable, secure, supportable, and freely redistributable base layer for your containers.
