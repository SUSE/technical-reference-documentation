== Introduction

=== Motivation

Modern software development is largely agile, open, and collaborative.

Nowhere has this been more obvious and impactful than in the domain of machine learning (ML).
ML is in a rapid state of continuous development, evolving a wealthy ecosystem of libraries, toolkits, and frameworks that enable developers to push the limits of hardware and software to solve previously intractable problems in record time.
But rapid development can lead to dependency conflicts, where two applications or even two components of the same application rely on different versions of the same library.

Today, developers have access to container technologies.
Containers provide a convenient, lightweight way to package your application components with the dependencies they require to run correctly while isolating them from other components.
Containers also enable massive scale, letting you run your applications everywhere they are needed - in the data center, in the cloud, and even at the edge.

=== Setting up Podman in SLES

==== Podman Overview

To build a container, you create a set of instructions that are handled by a container engine.
In SUSE Linux Enterprise, an excellent container engine choice is _Podman_.

Podman is short for Pod Manager Tool.
It is a daemonless container engine for developing, managing, and running Open Container Initiative (OCI) containers on a Linux system.
Podman offers a drop-in alternative for Docker and is the default container runtime in openSUSE Kubic — a certified Kubernetes distribution built on top of openSUSE.

You can read more about Podman from the 
https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/[Podman online documentation].

You can also learn more from the
https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/single-html/SLES-container/[SUSE Container Guide].

You will use Podman to create a container of the JupyterLab environment you have built.
You can easily move that container to other machines to be run by a container runtime, or run the container locally.


==== Installing Podman

To use Podman for your container creation, you will need to install it.
First, you need to enable the SUSE reposity for the Containers Module.

. Enable repo for the SUSE Containers Module
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.4/x86_64
----
+
TIP: The Containers Module is a free add-on module for your SUSE Linux Enterprise Server system.

With the Containers Module enabled, you can now install Podman.

. Install Podman
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo zypper in podman
----
+
TIP:  Often you also update your machine before installing new software.


=== SLE BCIs

==== SLE Base Container Images

SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) Base Container Images (BCI) are starting points for supported operating system code from SUSE.
The SLE BCIs are freely available, re-distributable, and supported across many different environments.
SLE BCIs are open, flexible, and secure container images and application development tools, that leverage SUSE Linux Enterprise.
These images are designed to be a secure base for any containerized workload and are great for machine-learning deployments.
Together with SUSE Edge technologies, SLE BCIs are used to quickly deploy ML applications on edge devices.

SLE BCI technology provides an enterprise better security and quality of their delivered applications and services.
By using SUSE-tested and support code, you can rely on the enhanced security that SUSE has invested in.
Your code will have higher-quality because you have based it on well-tested technologies, backed by a leading Linux vendor.

==== Python and JupyterLab

In this guide, you will containerizing your Python-based ML development environment.
This basic ML development environment was explained in the guide:
https://documentation.suse.com/trd/linux/single-html/gs_sles_jupyter-jupyterlab/[Replicable Python Environments with JupyterLab and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server].
The following instructions rely on work you did in that guide.
Please make sure you have a JupyterLab setup as describe there.

==== ML example - MNIST

This guide uses the MNIST example, which is something of a standard for getting started with machine-learning code and concepts.
The MNIST example does analysis of hand-written digits between 0-9.
The code is well defined and documented for this problem both online and via books such as, “Deep Learning with Python.” [cite: Manning].
MNIST has a relatively small set of training images that can easily be downloaded and analyzed on a laptop or desktop computer.
And, MNIST does not require expensive GPUs for hardware acceleration of the training process.


== Building a SLE BCI Container

Now it's time to create a container image from the JupyterLab install you did before.
This section will explain how to create your container image based on the SLE BCI container.


=== MNIST Model in a SLE BCI Container

There are two options to make a container with the code for the MNIST model.
The production option would be to build a web-based API to this code and put that in a container.
A development approach would be to work with this model in JupyterLab.
This guide will take the development approach.

=== Create the Containerfile

A _Containerfile_ is a set of instructions that tell the container engine how to build your container.
If you are familiar with Docker, a Containerfile has the same format as a Dockerfile.
You can read more about Containerfiles here:

* https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-build.1.html

* https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/Containerfile.5.md

Before you construct the Containerfile for the JupyterLab container, here's a useful tip about container user environments.

==== Linux User Environments in Containers

One reason that IT organizations prefer Podman is that it can run containers with requiring root access.
As you can imagine, having root access on the machines that run containers is a huge security hole.
In short, most IT organization will not allow root access on production environments.

Podman can run containers without requiring root access.
One way it does this is by using a Linux kernel feature called namespaces, which is widely used in container technologies.
User environments inside a namespace can be grouped and segmented away from the default user IDs.
This means your container will run as a different user ID on a target machine than your development user ID.
This is a great feature, but something we may want to change in a development scenario.

==== A Container Method to Map a User ID

The following example shows you how to map your current user ID to that of the running container.
This example uses the ENTRYPOINT feature of a Containerfile to leverage a script that passes your local user ID to the container.

The entrypoint script creates a username inside the container and use an environment variable to set the container's UID to that of the user executing the *podman run* command.

To view an example of this script, see: 
https://github.com/victorgregoriosuse/sle-bci-examples/blob/main/bci-jupyter/entrypoint.sh[entrypoint.sh].

A quick summary of what is happening in this script is important.
It is not important that you understand all the details of this script, unless it is interesting to you.

The entrypoint.sh script uses an environment variable, LOCAL_USERID, to pass an user id number to the container.
As you will see in the Containerfile shown below, you then run the entrypoint.sh script in your container.

=== Build the Container

You build a container through a description file, called the Containerfile.

You can read more about Containerfiles here:

* https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-build.1.html

* https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/Containerfile.5.md

Your goal is to create a simple development tool to share your MNIST experiment in JupyterLab.
An example Containfile is shown below.

. Containerfile for JupyterLab with MNIST
+
----
# https://registry.suse.com/
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest

ENV ZYPPERCMD="zypper --non-interactive"

RUN $ZYPPERCMD install python3 python3-pip
RUN python3 -m venv /home/virtenv

RUN . /home/virtenv/bin/activate && pip install --upgrade pip
RUN . /home/virtenv/bin/activate && pip install jupyterlab

# Expose the JupyterLab web port
EXPOSE 8888/tcp

# See: https://denibertovic.com/posts/handling-permissions-with-docker-volumes/
COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD [".", "/home/virtenv/bin/activate", "&&", "jupyter-lab"]
----
+
TIP:  For compatibility, Podman will also read files named Dockerfile.

The first element of the Containerfile to note is the FROM clause.
This instruction points to the SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Image (SLE BCI).

The RUN clauses will install JupyterLab in the container and the EXPOSE clause will open a TCP/IP port for the service.

You can learn more about containers in the https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/single-html/SLES-container/[SUSE Container Guide].
You might also want to read the section on https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/single-html/SLES-container/#cha-bci[SLE BCI].

Now you will build the container.
You need to create the Contailerfile with the contents described above.
The, use the podman command to build your container image.

NOTE: Use your favorite editor or _vi_ to paste the contents of Containfile.

// podman build
// $ podman build -t=ImageName -
. Build a container for your JupyerLab & MNIST example
+
[source, bash]
----
cd ~/py-keras
vi Containerfile
podman build . -t mnist
----
+
TIP: You may have to work through issues with your Containerfile to get your image built properly.


== Run the Container

The container image you have built now lives in the localhost repository and is tagged with the name _mnist_.
You can verify that your image has been created with the following podman command.

. Show the container images on your localhost
+
[source, bash]
----
podman images
----
+
TIP: Learn more about _podman_ commands at: https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Commands.html

It is only a little more complication to run the container you just created.
That is because we want to add the MNIST code to the container and pass our User ID.
The commands listed below depend upon the Bash shell as your default.
For more information on Bash, see https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/[GNU Bash].

// TARGET=jupyterlab
// mkdir -p $TARGET
// cp -f mnist_convnet.py $TARGET
// 
// podman run \
//   --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)/$TARGET",target=/home/$TARGET \
//   --network host \
//   --env LOCAL_USERID=$UID \
// localhost/mnist

. Run your container and pass it your User ID
+
[source, bash]
----
TARGET=jupyterlab
mkdir -p $TARGET
cp -f mnist_convnet.py $TARGET

podman run \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)/$TARGET",target=/home/$TARGET \
  --network host \
  --env LOCAL_USERID=$UID \
localhost/mnist
----
+
TIP: You could put these commands into a file, such as: _podmanrun.sh_


=== Test the Container

When _podman run_ command starts your container, you will see its output in your shell.
It will look something like this:

. Example output of the _podman run_ command
+
----

----
+
TIP:  If you see warnings, you should understand that aspect of the _podman run_ process.


At this point, you are ready to test your container.
The output shown above has an HTTP URL that you can use from your browser to interact with JupyterLab.
Copy the _localhost_ HTTP URL.
Paste that URL into your favorite browser.

You should see a JupyterLab web page, such as the one below.

Companies are transforming the way that software and services are being created.
Modern software is developed by teams that are agile, open, and collaborative.
Adding machine learning to the development process relies on collaborative tool and processes.

This guide has shown you how to create containers that are based on SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) Base Container Images (BCI).
BCI-based containers leverage proven, tested, and supported code from SUSE.
As such, SLE BCIs allow open, flexible, and secure development and are excellent for containerized workload and machine-learning deployments.
With SUSE Edge technologies, SLE BCIs help you to quickly deploy secure, high-quality ML applications on edge devices.

This guide showed steps to create a container of JupyterLab and code for the MNIST image analysis model.
There are other techniques to share code, that don't involve creating a container for JupyterLab.
The steps shown here are for your education and provide an interest web-based container example.

With the podman knowledge you've gained here, you are now ready to create your own BCI-based containers.
