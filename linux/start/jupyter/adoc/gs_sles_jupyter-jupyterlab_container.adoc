== Introduction

=== Motivation

Modern software development is largely agile, open, and collaborative.

Nowhere has this been more obvious and impactful than in the domain of machine learning (ML), where the development community comes from a broad spectrum of domains and backgrounds.
This has resulted in a rapid state of continuous development, evolving a wealthy ecosystem of software that enable developers to make amazing advances and push the limits of hardware to solve previously intractable problems in record time.
But rapid development can lead to dependency conflicts, where two applications or even two components of the same application rely on different versions of the same library.

Today, developers have access to container technologies that help overcome this challenge.
Containers provide a convenient, lightweight way to package your application components with their dependencies while isolating these from other components and their dependencies.
Containers also enable massive scale, letting you run your applications everywhere they are needed - in the data center, in the cloud, and even at the edge.


=== Scope

This document illustrates how to take the your first steps with containers to support ML development and implementation.


=== Audience

This document is intended for data scientists, ML developers, operations teams, systems architects and others interested in learning more about container technologies.
To progress with this document, the reader should have basic Linux command line skills and some knowledge of containers.


== Overview

=== Goals

In this guide, you learn how to:

* set up https://podman.io[Podman] on https://www.suse.com/products/server/[{productname}].

* specify and build a container for a https://jupyter.org/[JupyterLab] ML development environment.

* run your container and access the ML development environment.


=== Software ecosystem

. https://www.suse.com/products/server/[{productname}]
//
+
This guide leverages {productname} (SLE) as a host operating system for building and running containers.
SLE can be run on bare metal or in virtual machines to provide a stable, supportable Linux environment.
+
[NOTE]
====
Most of the steps outlined in this guide are directly transferable to https://www.opensuse.org/#Leap[{opensuse}].
====

. https://www.suse.com/products/base-container-images/[SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Images (SLE BCI)]
//
+
A base container image provides basic functionality, such as a stripped-down Linux operating system.
It is onto a base container image that you layer your application components.
SUSE base container images are freely available, re-distributable, supported across many different environments.
These images are designed to be a secure, flexible foundation for any containerized workload, including ML applications, that need to be deployed anywhere - in the data center, in the cloud, and even on edge devices.
+
[TIP]
====
SUSE maintains up-to-date, ready-to-use container images at https://registry.suse.com/[registry.suse.com].
====

. https://podman.io[Podman]
//
+
Podman, which is short for Pod Manager, is a daemonless, open source tool for finding, building, managing, and running https://opencontainers.org/[Open Container Initiative] (OCI) containers on Linux systems.
Podman is similar to other container engines (such as Docker, CRI-O, and containerd) and relies on an OCI compliant container runtime (like runc, crun, runv, and so on) to interface with the operating system for creating the running containers.
This means that running Podman containers is nearly indistinguishable from running those created by other common container engines.
You can also run Podman containers as an ordinary, non-privileged user, making it easier and more secure.
See the https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/single-html/SLES-container/[SUSE Container Guide] for a deeper discussion on containers and Podman.


. https://www.python.org/[Python]
//
+
Python has become a popular programming ecosystem for ML developers for its simplicity, elegance, extensibility, cross-platform availability, and active, open source community of developers and users.
With Python, ML developers have access to a vast collection of libraries, frameworks, and toolkits with which to build solutions to complex problems.


. https://jupyter.org/[JupyterLab]
//
+
JupyterLab is a modular, interactive development environment with a Web interface that enables data scientists and developers to create and share computational documents, called notebooks.


[TIP]
====
See https://documentation.suse.com/trd/linux/single-html/gs_sles_jupyter-jupyterlab/[Replicable Python Environments with JupyterLab and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server] to learn more about working with Python and JupyterLab on bare metal or in virtual machines.
====


== Enable Podman

Podman is not installed by default in {productname}.
So, your first step is to install it.


=== Install Podman

. Enable SUSE Containers Module.
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-module-containers/15.4/x86_64
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The Containers Module is a free add-on module for your SUSE Linux Enterprise Server system.
====

. Install Podman.
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo zypper in podman
----
+
[TIP]
====
It is a good idea to make sure your system is up-to-date with security patches and updates prior to installing new software.
You can do this by issuing the `sudo zypper up` command.
====


=== Configure Podman to run without root privileges

Podman can be run as an ordinary user, but you may need to make a few configuration changes.
To keep this simple, you will grant your current user, `$USER`, this access.

. Define subUID and subGID ranges for your current user.
//
+
You need to define a range of UIDs and GIDs that will be allocated to users inside the container and mapped onto the host.
You can check the '/etc/subuid' and '/etc/subgid' files to see if these ranges are already defined for your user.

If they are not, issue the command:
[source, bash]
----
sudo usermod --add-subuids 100000-165535 --add-subgids 100000-165535 ${USER}
----
+
[WARNING]
====
The subUID and subGID ranges ('100000-165535' in the command example) must not overlap for different users and not reuse UIDs and GIDs of existing users on the host.
====

. Ensure your current user has permissions to access zypper credentials on the host.
The container may need access to read the SUSE Customer Center credentials, located in '/etc/zypp/credentials.d'.
Grant permission to the user with:
[source, bash]
----
sudo setfacl -m u:${USER}:r /etc/zypp/credentials.d/*
----


=== Ensure Podman uses the correct storage driver

{productname} defines the default storage driver in '/etc/containers/storage.conf'

// continue here



=== Python and JupyterLab

https://jupyter.org/[JupyterLab] is an interactive development environment in the fashion of notebooks.

You can learn how to set up Python and JupyterLab on your laptop, desktop, VM, remote server, or virtual machine in https://documentation.suse.com/trd/linux/single-html/gs_sles_jupyter-jupyterlab/[Replicable Python Environments with JupyterLab and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server].

In this guide, you take the next step toward portability by containerizing this Python and JupyterLab ML development environment.


=== ML workload example

This guide uses MNIST as an example workload.
MNIST is something of a standard for getting started with ML code and concepts as you develop a computer vision model that can classify (or identify) hand-written digits between 0 and 9.
The code is well-defined and documented for this problem both online and in books, such as _Deep Learning with Python_. [cite: Manning].

MNIST has a relatively small set of training images that can be easily downloaded and analyzed on a laptop or desktop computer - or in a container.
And, MNIST does not require expensive GPUs for hardware acceleration of the training or inferencing processes.


== Building a container

In this section, you create a container image by adding an application layer on top of a SLE BCI foundation.
The application layer must include all the Python components needed to run JupyterLab and the MNIST example.

[TIP]
====
You may find it useful to reference a local installation of the environment, as detailed in https://documentation.suse.com/trd/linux/single-html/gs_sles_jupyter-jupyterlab/[Replicable Python Environments with JupyterLab and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server].
====


=== MNIST Model in a SLE BCI Container

There are two options to make a container with the code for the MNIST model.
The production option would be to build a web-based API to this code and put that in a container.
A development approach would be to work with this model in JupyterLab.
This guide will take the development approach.

=== Create the Containerfile

A _Containerfile_ is a set of instructions that tell the container engine how to build your container.
If you are familiar with Docker, a Containerfile has the same format as a Dockerfile.
You can read more about Containerfiles here:

* https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-build.1.html

* https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/Containerfile.5.md

Before you construct the Containerfile for the JupyterLab container, here's a useful tip about container user environments.

==== Linux User Environments in Containers

One reason that IT organizations prefer Podman is that it can run containers with requiring root access.
As you can imagine, having root access on the machines that run containers is a huge security hole.
In short, most IT organization will not allow root access on production environments.

Podman can run containers without requiring root access.
One way it does this is by using a Linux kernel feature called namespaces, which is widely used in container technologies.
User environments inside a namespace can be grouped and segmented away from the default user IDs.
This means your container will run as a different user ID on a target machine than your development user ID.
This is a great feature, but something we may want to change in a development scenario.

==== A Container Method to Map a User ID

The following example shows you how to map your current user ID to that of the running container.
This example uses the ENTRYPOINT feature of a Containerfile to leverage a script that passes your local user ID to the container.

The entrypoint script creates a username inside the container and use an environment variable to set the container's UID to that of the user executing the *podman run* command.

To view an example of this script, see: 
https://github.com/victorgregoriosuse/sle-bci-examples/blob/main/bci-jupyter/entrypoint.sh[entrypoint.sh].

A quick summary of what is happening in this script is important.
It is not important that you understand all the details of this script, unless it is interesting to you.

The entrypoint.sh script uses an environment variable, LOCAL_USERID, to pass an user id number to the container.
As you will see in the Containerfile shown below, you then run the entrypoint.sh script in your container.

=== Build the Container

You build a container through a description file, called the Containerfile.

You can read more about Containerfiles here:

* https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-build.1.html

* https://github.com/containers/common/blob/main/docs/Containerfile.5.md

Your goal is to create a simple development tool to share your MNIST experiment in JupyterLab.
An example Containfile is shown below.

. Containerfile for JupyterLab with MNIST
+
----
# https://registry.suse.com/
FROM registry.suse.com/bci/bci-base:latest

ENV ZYPPERCMD="zypper --non-interactive"

RUN $ZYPPERCMD install python3 python3-pip
RUN python3 -m venv /home/virtenv

RUN . /home/virtenv/bin/activate && pip install --upgrade pip
RUN . /home/virtenv/bin/activate && pip install jupyterlab

# Expose the JupyterLab web port
EXPOSE 8888/tcp

# See: https://denibertovic.com/posts/handling-permissions-with-docker-volumes/
COPY entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
RUN chmod +x /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"]
CMD [".", "/home/virtenv/bin/activate", "&&", "jupyter-lab"]
----
+
TIP:  For compatibility, Podman will also read files named Dockerfile.

The first element of the Containerfile to note is the FROM clause.
This instruction points to the SUSE Linux Enterprise Base Container Image (SLE BCI).

The RUN clauses will install JupyterLab in the container and the EXPOSE clause will open a TCP/IP port for the service.

You can learn more about containers in the https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/single-html/SLES-container/[SUSE Container Guide].
You might also want to read the section on https://documentation.suse.com/container/all/single-html/SLES-container/#cha-bci[SLE BCI].

Now you will build the container.
You need to create the Contailerfile with the contents described above.
The, use the podman command to build your container image.

NOTE: Use your favorite editor or _vi_ to paste the contents of Containfile.

// podman build
// $ podman build -t=ImageName -
. Build a container for your JupyerLab & MNIST example
+
[source, bash]
----
cd ~/py-keras
vi Containerfile
podman build . -t mnist
----
+
TIP: You may have to work through issues with your Containerfile to get your image built properly.


== Run the Container

The container image you have built now lives in the localhost repository and is tagged with the name _mnist_.
You can verify that your image has been created with the following podman command.

. Show the container images on your localhost
+
[source, bash]
----
podman images
----
+
TIP: Learn more about _podman_ commands at: https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/Commands.html

It is only a little more complication to run the container you just created.
That is because we want to add the MNIST code to the container and pass our User ID.
The commands listed below depend upon the Bash shell as your default.
For more information on Bash, see https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/[GNU Bash].

// TARGET=jupyterlab
// mkdir -p $TARGET
// cp -f mnist_convnet.py $TARGET
// 
// podman run \
//   --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)/$TARGET",target=/home/$TARGET \
//   --network host \
//   --env LOCAL_USERID=$UID \
// localhost/mnist

. Run your container and pass it your User ID
+
[source, bash]
----
TARGET=jupyterlab
mkdir -p $TARGET
cp -f mnist_convnet.py $TARGET

podman run \
  --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)/$TARGET",target=/home/$TARGET \
  --network host \
  --env LOCAL_USERID=$UID \
localhost/mnist
----
+
TIP: You could put these commands into a file, such as: _podmanrun.sh_


=== Test the Container

When _podman run_ command starts your container, you will see its output in your shell.
It will look something like this:

. Example output of the _podman run_ command
+
----

----
+
TIP:  If you see warnings, you should understand that aspect of the _podman run_ process.


At this point, you are ready to test your container.
The output shown above has an HTTP URL that you can use from your browser to interact with JupyterLab.
Copy the _localhost_ HTTP URL.
Paste that URL into your favorite browser.

You should see a JupyterLab web page, such as the one below.

Companies are transforming the way that software and services are being created.
Modern software is developed by teams that are agile, open, and collaborative.
Adding machine learning to the development process relies on collaborative tool and processes.

This guide has shown you how to create containers that are based on SUSE Linux Enterprise (SLE) Base Container Images (BCI).
BCI-based containers leverage proven, tested, and supported code from SUSE.
As such, SLE BCIs allow open, flexible, and secure development and are excellent for containerized workload and machine-learning deployments.
With SUSE Edge technologies, SLE BCIs help you to quickly deploy secure, high-quality ML applications on edge devices.

This guide showed steps to create a container of JupyterLab and code for the MNIST image analysis model.
There are other techniques to share code, that don't involve creating a container for JupyterLab.
The steps shown here are for your education and provide an interest web-based container example.

With the podman knowledge you've gained here, you are now ready to create your own BCI-based containers.
