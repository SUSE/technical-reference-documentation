== Introduction

=== Motivation

The https://www.python.org/[Python] programming ecosystem is popular for its simplicity, extensibility, cross-platform availability, and its large open source community of active developers and users.
Developers in many domains benefit from and contribute to the large and growing Python ecosystem of open source tools and libraries.
This has resulted in a rapid state of continuous development for the language and for the domains where Python is used.

The modern Python developer's environment can be highly complex, leveraging a wealth of libraries, each with its own development life cycle and dependencies.
Such complexity makes it difficult to faithfully replicate and share a development environment for collaboration, testing, and deployment.
This is especially relevant in scientific computing, including the modern field of machine learning, where experimental replication is critical for validation but minor variations in the complex weave of library dependencies could invalidate test results or lead to unexpected behaviors in production.


=== Scope

This guide helps you take a first step to overcoming the challenge of creating and sharing replicable Python development environments.

Specifically, you get a brief introduction to the following concepts, systems, tools, and applications:

* https://{product1_url}[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server], the adaptable, reliable, and secure platform that enables you to go from development to production with confidence.

* https://www.python.org/[Python] programming ecosystem.

* https://pypi.org/[Python Package Index (PyPI)], the Python software repository.

* Lightweight virtual environments with https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[`venv`].

* Python package management with https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/[`pip`].

* Interactive, computational notebooks with https://jupyter.org/[Project Jupyter]


[NOTE]
====
Many of the steps herein may be followed with little or no modification on the corresponding version of openSUSE Leap.
====


=== Audience

This guide is intended for researchers, engineers, developers, operations teams, and others interested in implementing replicable, ML development environments, featuring Python and computational documents with JupyterLab.
The reader should have basic Linux command line skills.


== Prerequisites

For this guide, you need:

* {product1_full} ({product1})
//
+
** If you do not already have {product1} installed on your system (bare metal or virtual machine), see the https://{product1_docs}/html/SLES-all/article-installation.html[Installation Quick Start] and https://{product1_docs}/html/SLES-all/book-deployment.html[Deployment Guide].

** Make sure your {product1} installation is up-to-date by running `zypper patch`, `zypper update`, or by using https://{product1_docs}/html/SLES-all/cha-onlineupdate-you.html[YaST online update].

* Python 3
+
--
https://www.python.org/[Python] is a powerful, easy to learn, open source programming language.

For this guide, you will install a newer version of Python from the SLES software repositories alongside the default or "system" version.
--

* Internet access
+
//
You need Internet access to download additional libraries and applications used in this guide.



== Setting up your Python environment

Developers use Python in Web and Internet development, mobile and desktop applications, systems management and automation, and so much more.
Python has also become very popular in scientific and analytics use cases, including machine learning and artificial intelligence.

Some disciplines, like machine learning, are developing rapidly and often have strict version requirements for not only the version of Python but also for a variety of other libraries and packages.

Developers need a mechanism for isolating all the required dependencies for a project from other projects and the operating system's Python toolchain.



=== Addressing Python versions

{product1} ships with a default version of Python.
This "system" Python was thoroughly tested with the libraries and tools that make up the operating system.
This version is adequate for many use cases.
Some disciplines, like machine learning, are developing rapidly and often have strict version dependencies.
And your application may have a hard dependency for a specific version of the Python interpreter itself.

You can install newer versions of Python through a variety of mechanisms.
In fact, you can have multiple versions of Python installed simultaneously.
But care must be taken not to break dependencies for system tools or other applications.
You can mitigate this risk by installing Python from the official {product1} software repositories.

Typically, two Python versions are available to you in the {product1} software repositories.
The default version is often integrated with various, Python-based system tools.
At the time of this guide's publication, the default version is Python {python_default_ver}.
The Python interpreter is installed as the executable file, `/usr/bin/{python_default_bin}`, and this is symbolically linked so it may be called with `/usr/bin/python3` or, simply, `python3`.

Try it:

[source, console]
----
python3 --version
----

When you install a newer Python from the {product1} repositories, it is installed with unique file and directory names.
At publication of this guide, Python {python_new_ver} is available in the official repositories.
The interpreter for this Python is the file, `/usr/bin/{python_new_ver}`.

You should use the Python packages in the official SUSE repositories when possible.
If you must use a different version, you can build and install it from source code, but be sure to specify unique naming to avoid conflicts.

[NOTE]
====
There are tools, like https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv], that are designed to help you install and manage multiple versions of Python.
It is also possible to install a curated distribution of Python, such as https://www.anaconda.com/[Anaconda]).
These options have their own benefits and drawbacks.
For now, they are out of scope of this guide.
====


Follow the steps below to install the latest Python from the official {product1} software repositories.

. List the available Python 3 Interpeter packages.
+
[source, console]
----
sudo zypper search -d "Python 3 Interpreter"
----
+
This command produces output like:
+
[listing, subs="attributes"]
----
S  | Name                | Summary                                 | Type
---+---------------------+-----------------------------------------+--------
i  | python3             | Python 3 Interpreter                    | package
i  | python3-base        | Python 3 Interpreter and Stdlib Core    | package
   | python3-pyotherside | Asynchronous Python 3 Bindings for Qt 5 | package
   | python311           | Python 3 Interpreter                    | package
   | python311-base      | Python 3 Interpreter and Stdlib Core    | package
----
+
You see the installed, default Python 3 packages and an additional version (Python {python_new_ver}) is available. 

. Install the newer Python 3 packages.
+
[source, console, subs="attributes"]
----
sudo zypper install {python_new_pkg}
----

. Verify installation.
+
[source, console, subs="attributes"]
----
/usr/bin/{python_new_bin} --version
----
or, with `/usr/bin/` in your path:
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
{python_new_bin} --version
----


[WARNING]
====
The default Python is still symbolically linked to `/usr/bin/python3`.
Do not change this symbolic link, as this could break system tools that rely on the default version.
====



=== Creating a Python virtual environment

The https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html[Python `venv` module] provides a mechanism for creating lightweight "virtual environments" and gives us a tool for isolating software dependencies.
See the https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/[Python Enhancement Proposal 405 - Python Virtual Environments] for more details on the `venv` module.

Creating a Python virtual environment is easy.
Run the following commands as your user (root access is not required):

. Create a virtual environment, named 'myproj'.
+
[source, bash, subs="attributes"]
----
{newpythonbin} -m venv $HOME/myproj
----
+
This creates a new `myproj/` subdirectory in your home directory and populates it with files, subdirectories, and symbolic links to enable the virtual environment to use the Python interpreter you specify with this command.

. Change to the new directory.
+
[source, bash]
----
cd $HOME/myproj
----

. Activate the new virtual environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
source ./bin/activate
----
+
The `activate` script cannot be run on its own and must be "sourced" to update current environment variables in support of the isolated environment.
+
[TIP]
====
When your virtual environment is active, your command prompt is prefixed with the environment name.
In the present example, you should see '(myproj)' before your normal prompt.
====

. Deactivate your active virtual environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
deactivate
----
+
When you are done working in this virtual environment, you can use the `deactivate` command to reset all the environment changes (including your prompt).
This does not delete the virtual environment.
To reactivate it, simply source the activate script again.

You can use the Python `venv` module to create as many virtual environments as you need, each in its own working directory.


[NOTE]
====
If you no longer need a virtual environment and want to delete it, simply:

. deactivate the environment.

. delete its directory.
====



== Managing Python packages

The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server repositories include many Python packages, tested against the included version of Python.
These can be installed system-wide and are fine for many development projects.
Sometimes your project may require a different version of one of these packages or a package not available in the standard repositories.
In these cases, you may choose to use the https://pypi.org/[Python Package Index (PyPI)].
This is a public repository of open source licensed packages made available by a community of developers from around the world.

There are many ways to install Python packages from PyPI, but the preferred method is with https://pypi.org/project/pip/[`pip`].
`pip` is a powerful tool for managing Python packages from PyPI, but it can also install from a Git repository or from local distribution files.

Many Python packages are dependent on other packages.
But manually identifying and installing all dependencies can be grueling, especially when each package may have additional dependencies of its own.
Fortunately, `pip` automatically performs dependency resolution to ensure installation of all required packages and alerts you if resolution fails.
See the https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/[`pip` documentation] for details.

[NOTE]
====
Your Python virtual environment has its own _pip_ executable and symbolic links to the Python interpreter you used to create it.
These are located in the _bin/_ subdirectory of your working directory.
After activating your virtual environment, use `python --version` and `pip --version` to verify the versions of these commands.
====


=== Performing basic package management

With the following commands, you will perform some basic operations with the `pip` package installer.

. Activate your virtual environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
cd $HOME/myproj
source ./bin/activate
----

. Upgrade `pip` itself to the latest version.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install --upgrade pip
----

. Install a specific version of the https://pypi.org/project/numpy/1.18.5/[`numpy`] package.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install numpy==1.18.5
----
+
[TIP]
====
Be sure to use two equal signs ('==') between the package name and the desired version.
====

. Upgrade to the latest compatible version of `numpy`.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install --upgrade numpy
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You may not actually get the _latest_ version of a package.
Instead, you get the latest version that is compatible with your Python environment.
====

. Uninstall `numpy`.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip uninstall numpy
----

. Install multiple packages (`numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`) together.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
----
+
[source, bash]
----

----
+
[NOTE]
====
Because some additional packages are required by those requested, `pip` automatically downloads and installs them.
====


=== Creating replicable experiments

Repeatability is key to many disciplines, but particularly in the sciences.
Ensuring that your Python environment can be recreated the same way with the same packages and the same versions of those packages can be a challenge.

Fortunately, with the `pip freeze` command, you can generate a package requirements file, containing a list of the packages and versions that should be installed.
See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_freeze/ for more information.


Create a requirements file for your Python virtual environment by following these steps:

. Activate your virtual environment (if not already active).

. Generate a requirements file with `pip freeze`.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip freeze > requirements.txt
----

. Take a look at the requirements file.
+
[source, bash]
----
cat requirements.txt
----
+
[source, bash]
----
cycler==0.11.0
kiwisolver==1.3.1
matplotlib==3.3.4
numpy==1.19.5
pandas==1.1.5
Pillow==8.4.0
pyparsing==3.0.9
python-dateutil==2.8.2
pytz==2022.2.1
six==1.16.0
----


When you have a requirements file, you can share it with another developer or use it yourself to make sure a new environment contains all the same packages.

. If you are in an active virtual environment, deactivate it and leave that working directory.
+
[source, bash]
----
deactivate
cd ..
----

. Create a new Python virtual environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
python3 -m venv myproj2
----

. Enter the working directory and activate the new environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
cd myproj2
source ./bin/activate
----

. Upgrade `pip`.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install --upgrade pip
----

. Install packages with the requirements file.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install -r ../myproj/requirements.txt
----

. Verify correct packages are installed.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip freeze
----
+
[source, bash]
----
cycler==0.11.0
kiwisolver==1.3.1
matplotlib==3.3.4
numpy==1.19.5
pandas==1.1.5
Pillow==8.4.0
pyparsing==3.0.9
python-dateutil==2.8.2
pytz==2022.2.1
six==1.16.0
----
+
[TIP]
====
`pip freeze` excludes `pip` and a few other packages.
To see a complete list of packages, use `pip list`.
====



== Project Jupyter and JuypterLab

https://jupyter.org/[Project Jupyter] was born out of the https://ipython.org/[IPython Project] in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across more programming languages.

Under the Jupyter umbrella are:

* Jupyter Notebook: the original Web application that allows data scientists to create and share computational documents, called notebooks.

* JupyterLab: the latest generation of Jupyter Notebook with a modular design to allow users to customize the interface to support workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

* JupyterHub: the multiuser version of Jupyter Notebook that enables companies, classrooms, and research labs to deliver computational environments and resources to users while managing them centrally.

* Voilà: a tool that transforms Jupyter notebooks into secure, stand-alone Web applications.


[NOTE]
====
The Jupyter team maintains the IPython project and includes the IPython kernel (IPyKernel) by default to enable interactive Python in JupyterLab.
A variety of community maintained kernels are available to enable use of other programming languages, such as https://irkernel.github.io/[R], https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl[Julia], and https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels[many others].
====


=== Getting JupyterLab up and running

JupyterLab is a Web application, so you need a Web browser to access it.

. Install JupyterLab.
//
+
JupyterLab is easy to install right from PyPI.
In your active virtual environment, issue the command:
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install jupyterlab
----

. Update your requirements file so JupyterLab will be included.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip freeze > requirements.txt
----
+
[TIP]
====
Update your requirements file each time you install packages.
====

. Launch JupyterLab.
//
+
Once JupyterLab is installed, launch it with the command:
+
[source, bash]
----
jupyter-lab
----
+
In your terminal window, you see something like the following:
+
[source, bash]
----
[I 2022-08-22 13:14:26.394 ServerApp] Jupyter Server 1.13.1 is running at:
[I 2022-08-22 13:14:26.394 ServerApp] http://localhost:8888/lab?token=4baab78a6959bbc8b9992572b8faf7d2416741c2d00768f7
[I 2022-08-22 13:14:26.394 ServerApp]  or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=4baab78a6959bbc8b9992572b8faf7d2416741c2d00768f7
[I 2022-08-22 13:14:26.394 ServerApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 2022-08-22 13:14:26.398 ServerApp] 
    
    To access the server, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/suse/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-31811-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/lab?token=4baab78a6959bbc8b9992572b8faf7d2416741c2d00768f7
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=4baab78a6959bbc8b9992572b8faf7d2416741c2d00768f7
----

. Access the JupyterLab user interface (UI).
//
+
JupyterLab will attempt to open your default Web browser to the UI.
If this fails, you can manually open your browser to one of the URLs provided in your terminal window.
//
+
[NOTE]
====
JupyterLab uses an access token to authenticate you to the Web UI.
This token is unique to each instance of the environment.
====
//
+
[TIP]
====
If your environment is on a remote, headless host, you can use SSH port forwarding to gain access.

. Log in to the remote host with a local port forward.
+
[source, bash]
----
ssh -L8888:localhost:8888 USER@REMOTE-IP
----
+
where USER is your user name on the remote host and REMOTE-IP is its IP address or domain name.

. Activate your virtual environment.

. Launch JupyterLab.

. Open your local Web browser to the URL (with your access token) specified in the command terminal.
====

. Shut down JupyterLab.
//
+
Shutting down JupyterLab means stopping running extensions, kernels, terminals, and the UI.
//
+
Shut down JupyterLab directly from the UI by selecting __Shutdown__ under the __File__ menu.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you select __Logout__ from the __File__ menu or close your browser, the JupyterLab environment continues to run.
You can shut it down from the command terminal by issuing 'CTRL-C'.
You will be prompted to confirm that you want to shut down the Jupyter server.
Bypass confirmation by issuing 'CTRL-C' twice.
====



=== Exploring JupyterLab

JupyterLab has many of the features of a traditional integrated development environment (IDE), but it focuses on interactive and exploratory computing.

The main JupyterLab interface consists of a menu at the top, a collapsible sidebar on the left, and a main work area in the middle.

image::jupyterlab_ui_001.png[JupyterLab UI Launcher, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

The menu provides access to some familiar functions, like file management, editing functions, UI view and settings, and help.
It also includes functions specific to working in an interactive computing environment, like running code and managing compute kernels.

The sidebar offers a file browser, process controls, extension management, and more.

JupyterLab opens with the main work area displaying the __Launcher__ tab.
From the __Launcher__, you can start a notebook, console, terminal window, and more.
These appear as additional tab in the main work area.

[TIP]
====
If you accidentally close the __Launcher__, you can open a new one from the __File__ menu.
====


Try creating a notebook.

. Start a notebook by clicking __Python 3__ in the __Notebook__ area of the __Launcher__.
+
image::jupyterlab-ui-notebook-001.png[Empty Jupyter notebook, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. In the first command cell of your notebook, enter:
+
[source, python]
----
from sys import version
----
+
Press 'CTRL-ENTER' at the end of the line to execute it.
+
[TIP]
====
You can enter multiple lines by pressing 'ENTER' at the end of each line.
The code will not execute until you press 'CTRL-ENTER'.
====

. In the second command cell, enter:
+
[source, python]
----
print(version)
----
+
image::jupyterlab-ui-notebook-002.png[Jupyter notebook with two command examples, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Save your notebook by selecting __Save Notebook As...__ from the __File__ menu.
//
+
Enter a name when prompted, such as `mypythonversion.ipynb`.

. Close your notebook by clicking the 'X' in the notebook tab.

. Reopen your notebook by double-clicking `mypythonversion.ipynb` in the sidebar file browser.


=== Collaborating with JupyterLab

JupyterLab provides a great environment for interactive experimentation, and the notebook format offers an easy mechanism for sharing your code with others.
But a Jupyter notebook by itself may not be sufficient, as your colleague's development environment may be different.

When you are ready to share your work, you should include your:

* notebook
* data
* requirements file

With these three items, your colleague can recreate your development environment and run your code against your data.




== Summary
