== Introduction

=== Motivation

// Why this would be of interest
// Challenges
// Benefits

The https://www.python.org/[Python] programming ecosystem is popular among many developers for its simplicity, extensibility, cross-platform availability, 
and its large open source community of active developers and users.
Developers in many domains benefit from and contribute to the large and growing Python ecosystem of open source tools and libraries.
This has resulted in a rapid state of continuous development for the language and for the domains where Python is used.

The modern developer leverages this wealth of libraries and frameworks.
This can result in highly complex development environments that are difficult to replicate and share.
Fortunately, the modern developer has many solutions to this problem.



=== Scope

This guide helps you take a first step to setting up replicable Python development environments with https://www.suse.com/products/server/[SUSE Linux Enterprise], 
an operating system that is adaptable to any environment - optimized for performance, security, and reliability.

Specifically, you will get a brief introduction to the following concepts, tools, and applications:

* https://www.python.org/[Python] in the {productname} environment.

* The https://pypi.org/[Python Package Index (*PyPI*)] software repository.

* Lightweight virtual environments with https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html[*venv*].

* Python package management with https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/[*pip*].

* Interactive, computational notebooks with https://jupyter.org/[*Project Jupyter*]


[NOTE]
====
Many of the steps herein may be followed with little or no modification on the corresponding version of openSUSE Leap.
====


=== Audience

This guide is intended for researchers, engineers, developers, operations teams, and others interested in implementing replicable, ML development environments, 
featuring Python and computational documents with JupyterLab.
The reader should have basic Linux command line skills.


== Prerequisites

For this guide, you need:

* https://www.suse.com/products/server/[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server] {productver} or the corresponding version of https://www.opensuse.org/[openSUSE] Leap.

** If you do not already have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installed, instructions can be found here: https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/book-deployment.html

** Make sure your SUSE Linux Enterprise Server installation is up-to-date by running `zypper patch`, `zypper update`, or by using https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-onlineupdate-you.html[YaST online update].

* Python 3
+
//
{defaultpython} is included with {productname} and is used in this guide.
This is adequate to run JupyterLab and many ML toolkits.
+
[NOTE]
====
Legacy Python 2.x and other versions of Python can also be installed on your system.
To avoid accidentally executing the wrong version, this guide uses version-explicit commands, like `{defaultpythonbin}` or `python3` (leveraging a symbolic link to the appropriate binary).
====

* Access to https://pypi.org/[The Python Package Index (PyPI)].
+
//
PyPI is a public repository of software for the Python programming language.



== Setting up your Python environment

Some disciplines, like machine learning, are in fast development and often have strict version dependencies.
Installing dependent packages to support one project may thus break another project.
Developers need a way to create isolated environments where they can install the packages they need without impacting other projects or systems operations.


=== Addressing Python versions

Your application may have a hard dependency for a specific version of the Python interpreter itself.

You can install multiple versions of Python on your system.
But care must be taken, as doing so incorrectly could break system tools.

To mitigate this risk, SUSE names the Python binaries explicitly.
For example, {productname} includes {defaultpython} and the default Python interpreter is the file, '/usr/bin/{defaultpythonbin}'.
This file is symbolically linked as 'python3' to simplify usage and offer consistency.
So, when you issue the command `python3 --version`, this is actually executing, `{defaultpythonbin} --version`.
If you install another version of Python from the SUSE repositories, say Python 3.10, the interpreter will be installed as '/usr/bin/python3.10'.

With this naming convention, you can install and maintain multiple versions of Python system-wide.
You can also choose to install Python elsewhere on the system, including in your user home directory.
In either case, you need to explicitly call the version of Python.

Tools like https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv[pyenv] have been developed to help simplify the management of multiple Python versions, but this is out of scope for this document.

For this guide, the default {defaultpython} is sufficient.


=== Creating a Python virtual environment

The https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html[Python *venv* module] provides a mechanism for creating lightweight "virtual environments" and gives us a tool for isolating software dependencies.
See the https://peps.python.org/pep-0405/[Python Enhancement Proposal 405 - Python Virtual Environments] for more details on the *venv* module.

Creating a Python virtual environment is easy.
Run the following commands as your user (root access is not required):

. Create a virtual environment, named 'myproj'.
+
[source,bash]
----
python3 -m venv $HOME/myproj
----
+
This creates a new 'myproj' subdirectory in your home directory and populates it with files, subdirectories, and symbolic links to enable the virtual environment.

. Change to the new directory.
+
[source, bash]
----
cd $HOME/myproj
----

. Activate the new virtual environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
source ./bin/activate
----
+
The 'activate' script cannot be run on its own and must be "sourced" to update current environment variables in support of the isolated environment.
+
[TIP]
====
When your virtual environment is active, your command prompt is prefixed with the environment name.
In the present example, you should see '(myproj)' before your normal prompt.
====

. Deactivate your active virtual environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
deactivate
----
+
When you are done working in this virtual environment, you can use the `deactivate` command to reset all the environment changes (including your prompt).
This does not delete the virtual environment.
To reactivate it, simply source the activate script again.

You can use the Python *venv* module to create as many virtual environments as you need, each in its own working directory.


[NOTE]
====
If you no longer need a virtual environment and want to delete it, simply:

. deactivate the environment.
. delete its working directory.
====



== Managing Python packages

The {productname} repositories include many of Python packages, tested against the included version of Python.
These can be installed system-wide and are fine for many development projects.
However, your project may require a different version of one of these packages or a package not included in the standard repositories.

The https://pypi.org/[Python Package Index (PyPI)] is a public repository of open source licensed packages made available by a community of developers from around the world.
There are many ways to install Python packages from PyPI, but the preferred method is with https://pypi.org/project/pip/[*pip*].

*pip* is a powerful tool for managing Python packages.
By default, *pip* installs packages from PyPI, but it can also install from a Git repository or from local distribution files.

Many Python packages are dependent on other packages.
But manually identifying and installing all dependencies can be grueling, especially when each package may have additional dependencies of its own.
Fortunately, *pip* automatically performs dependency resolution to ensure installation of all required packages and alerts you if resolution fails.
See the https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/[*pip* documentation] for details.

Following the instructions of this guide, you will use *pip* to install packages from PyPI into your active virtual environment.


[NOTE]
====
Your Python virtual environment has its own *pip* executable, installed in the 'bin' subdirectory of your working directory (for example '$HOME/myproj/bin').
Use `pip --version` to see which *pip* executable will be used.
====


=== Performing basic package management

With the following commands, you will perform some basic operations with the *pip* package installer.

. Activate your virtual environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
cd $HOME/myproj
source ./bin/activate
----

. Upgrade *pip* itself to the latest version.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install --upgrade pip
----

. Install a specific version of the https://pypi.org/project/numpy/1.18.5/[`numpy`] package.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install numpy==1.18.5
----
+
[TIP]
====
Be sure to use two equal signs ('==') between the package name and the desired version.
====

. Upgrade to the latest compatible version of `numpy`.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install --upgrade numpy
----
+
[NOTE]
====
You may not actually get the _latest_ version of a package.
Instead, you get the latest version that is compatible with your Python environment.
====

. Uninstall `numpy`.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip uninstall numpy
----

. Install multiple packages (`numpy`, `pandas`, and `matplotlib`) together.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
----
+
[source, bash]

----
+
[NOTE]
====
Because some additional packages are required by those requested, *pip* automatically downloads and installs them.
====


=== Creating replicable experiments

Repeatability is key to many disciplines, but particularly in the sciences.
Ensuring that your Python environment can be recreated the same way with the same packages and the same versions of those packages can be a challenge.

Fortunately, with the `pip freeze` command, you can generate a package requirements file, containing a list of the packages and versions that should be installed.
See https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_freeze/ for more information.


Create a requirements file for your Python virtual environment by following these steps:

. Activate your virtual environment (if not already active).

. Generate a requirements file with `pip freeze`.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip freeze > requirements.txt
----

. Take a look at the requirements file.
+
[source, bash]
----
cat requirements.txt
----
+
[source, bash]
----
cycler==0.11.0
kiwisolver==1.3.1
matplotlib==3.3.4
numpy==1.19.5
pandas==1.1.5
Pillow==8.4.0
pyparsing==3.0.9
python-dateutil==2.8.2
pytz==2022.2.1
six==1.16.0
----


When you have a requirements file, you can share it with another developer or use it yourself to make sure a new environment contains all the same packages.

. If you are in an active virtual environment, deactivate it and leave that working directory.
+
[source, bash]
----
deactivate
cd ..
----

. Create a new Python virtual environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
python3 -m venv myproj2
----

. Enter the working directory and activate the new environment.
+
[source, bash]
----
cd myproj2
source ./bin/activate
----

. Upgrade *pip*.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install --upgrade pip
----

. Install packages with the requirements file.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install -r ../myproj/requirements.txt
----

. Verify correct packages were installed.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip freeze
----
+
[source, bash]
----
cycler==0.11.0
kiwisolver==1.3.1
matplotlib==3.3.4
numpy==1.19.5
pandas==1.1.5
Pillow==8.4.0
pyparsing==3.0.9
python-dateutil==2.8.2
pytz==2022.2.1
six==1.16.0
----
+
[TIP]
====
`pip freeze` excludes *pip* and a few other packages.
To see a complete list of packages, use `pip list`.
====



== Project Jupyter and JuypterLab

https://jupyter.org/[Project Jupyter] was born out of the https://ipython.org/[IPython Project] in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across more programming languages.

Under the Jupyter umbrella are:

* Jupyter Notebook: the original Web application that allows data scientists to create and share computational documents, called notebooks.

* JupyterLab: the latest generation of Jupyter Notebook with a modular design to allow users to customize the interface to support workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

* JupyterHub: the multiuser version of Jupyter Notebook that enables companies, classrooms, and research labs to deliver computational environments and resources to users while managing them centrally.

* Voilà: a tool that transforms Jupyter notebooks into secure, stand-alone Web applications.


[NOTE]
====
The Jupyter team maintains the IPython project and includes the IPython kernel (IPyKernel) by default to enable interactive Python in JupyterLab.
A variety of community maintained kernels are available to enable use of other programming languages, such as https://irkernel.github.io/[R], https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl[Julia], and https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels[many others].
====


=== Getting JupyterLab up and running

JupyterLab is a Web application, so you need a Web browser to access it.

. Install JupyterLab.
//
+
JupyterLab is easy to install right from PyPI.
In your active virtual environment, issue the command:
+
[source, bash]
----
pip install jupyterlab
----

. Update your requirements file so JupyterLab will be included.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip freeze > requirements.txt
----
+
[TIP]
====
Update your requirements file each time you install packages.
====

. Launch JupyterLab.
//
+
Once JupyterLab is installed, launch it with the command:
+
[source, bash]
----
jupyter-lab
----
+
In your terminal window, you should see something like the following:
+
[source, bash]
----
[I 2022-08-22 13:14:26.394 ServerApp] Jupyter Server 1.13.1 is running at:

[I 2022-08-22 13:14:26.394 ServerApp] Use Control-C to stop this server and shut down all kernels (twice to skip confirmation).
[C 2022-08-22 13:14:26.398 ServerApp] 
    
    To access the server, open this file in a browser:
        file:///home/suse/.local/share/jupyter/runtime/jpserver-31811-open.html
    Or copy and paste one of these URLs:
        http://localhost:8888/lab?token=4baab78a6959bbc8b9992572b8faf7d2416741c2d00768f7
     or http://127.0.0.1:8888/lab?token=4baab78a6959bbc8b9992572b8faf7d2416741c2d00768f7
----

. Access the JupyterLab user interface (UI).
//
+
JupyterLab will attempt to open your default Web browser to the UI.
If this fails, you can manually open your browser to one of the URLs provided in your terminal window.
//
+
[NOTE]
====
JupyterLab uses an access token to authenticate you to the Web UI.
This token is unique to each instance of the environment.
====
//
+
[TIP]
====
If your environment is on a remote, headless host, you can use SSH port forwarding to gain access.

. Log in to the remote host with a local port forward.
+
[source, bash]
----
ssh -L8888:localhost:8888 USER@REMOTE-IP
----
+
where USER is your user name on the remote host and REMOTE-IP is its IP address or domain name.

. Activate your virtual environment.

. Launch JupyterLab.

. Open your local Web browser to the URL (with your access token) specified in the command terminal.
====

. Shut down JupyterLab.
//
+
Shutting down JupyterLab means stopping running extensions, kernels, terminals, and the UI.
//
+
Shut down JupyterLab directly from the UI by selecting __Shutdown__ under the __File__ menu.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you select __Logout__ from the __File__ menu or close your browser, the JupyterLab environment continues to run.
You can shut it down from the command terminal by issuing 'CTRL-C'.
You will be prompted to confirm that you want to shut down the Jupyter server.
Bypass confirmation by issuing 'CTRL-C' twice.
====

. Update your requirements file.
+
[source, bash]
----
pip freeze > requirements.txt
----
+
[TIP]
====
You should update your project requirements file each time you install new packages.
====


=== Exploring JupyterLab

JupyterLab has many of the features of a traditional integrated development environment (IDE), but it focuses on interactive and exploratory computing.

The main JupyterLab interface consists of a menu at the top, a collapsible sidebar on the left, and a main work area in the middle.

image::jupyterlab_ui_001.png[JupyterLab UI Launcher, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

The menu provides access to some familiar functions, like file management, editing functions, UI view and settings, and help.
It also includes functions specific to working in an interactive computing environment, like running code and managing compute kernels.

The sidebar offers a file browser, process controls, extension management, and more.

JupyterLab opens with the main work area displaying the __Launcher__ tab.
From the Launcher tab, you can start a notebook, console, terminal window, and more.
These appear as additional tab in the main work area.

[TIP]
====
If you accidentally close the __Launcher__ tab, you can open a new one from the __File__ menu.
====


Try creating a notebook.

. Start a notebook by clicking __Python 3__ in the __Notebook__ area of the __Launcher__.
+
image::jupyterlab-ui-notebook-001.png[Empty Jupyter notebook, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. In the first command cell of your notebook, enter:
+
[source, python]
----
from sys import version
----
+
Press 'CTRL-ENTER' at the end of the line to execute it.
+
[TIP]
====
You can enter multiple lines by pressing 'ENTER' at the end of each line.
The code will not execute until you press 'CTRL-ENTER'.
====

. In the second command cell, enter:
+
[source, python]
----
print(version)
----
+
image::jupyterlab-ui-notebook-002.png[Jupyter notebook with two command examples, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Save your notebook by selecting __Save Notebook As...__ from the __File__ menu.
//
+
Enter a name when prompted, such as 'mypythonversion.ipynb'.

. Close your notebook by clicking the 'X' in the notebook tab.

. Reopen your notebook by double-clicking 'mypythonversion.ipynb' in the sidebar file browser.


=== Collaborating with JupyterLab

JupyterLab provides a great environment for interactive experimentation, and the notebook format offers an easy mechanism for sharing your code with others.
But a Jupyter notebook by itself may not be sufficient, as your colleague's development environment may be different.

When you are ready to share your work, you should include your:

* notebook
* data
* requirements file

With these three items, your colleague can recreate your development environment and run your code against your data.
