== Introduction

=== Motivation

// Why this would be of interest
// Challenges
// Benefits

// B: There is some good text here (https://medium.com/@olivier.borderies/jupyter-python-in-the-corporate-lan-109e2ffde897) to explain why JupyterLab.  We would just want to integrate in SLE value.




=== Scope

// This guide will help you take the first steps to 

This guide illustrates how to install, configure, and access JupyterLab on SUSE Linux Enterprise.


=== Audience

// This document is intended for 

This guide is intended for developers, data scientists, machine learning researchers, and others interested in leveraging the JupyterLab, next generation, interctive, computational notebook environment.


== Technical overview

// Description
// B: Perhaps, describe JupyterLab here, talk about how it's accessed through the web browser, and include a screenshot.
// B: It probably wouldn't hurt to discuss that JupyterLab also supports other kernels besides Python, such as R and Julia, but I would recommend focusing only on iPython.

// Architecture diagram - B: This doesn't seem necessary in this doc.  Use a screenshot of the interface instead.

// Minimum requirements (prerequisites) for this guide
// * Requirement 1 https://url[url]
// * Requirement 2 https://url[url]

For this guide, you need:
// B: Flesh out the list below.
* Computer system // should we include any specs?
* Internet access // not much else to say, except maybe access to PyPI
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4 // okay, expand this to make it clear that we are specifically documenting SLES 15 SP4 but SLED 15 SP4, and openSUSE Leap 15.4 would also work.



== Installation

//Provide steps or link to existing document.
//[source, bash]
//---
//echo "Use code blocks for command-line steps."
//---

// B: For installation, use https://jupyter.org/install as a guide.
// B: I recommend walking through creating a Python virtual environment with the `venv` module and also include steps for saving the configuration with `pip freeze` for repeatable configurations.
// B: We could also discuss `pipenv`: https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/.
// B: I would not introduce conda or mamba.
// B: Oh, focus on Python3, not Python2.






== Use case and demonstration

//Describe use case and demonstration.

//[NOTE]
//====
// Use admonitions (i.e., NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, CAUTION, WARNING) as needed.
//====

//Use sections to break up major actions, such as:
//=== Prepare the demonstration environment (beyond installation)
//=== Perform action (to illustrate capability)
//=== Examine results (verifying capability)
//Use ordered lists for steps.
//Minimize/consolidate images whenever possible.

// B: Take a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/examples/ for some examples.  Let's keep the example here simple.  We're really focused on just getting JupyterLab with SLE into the mind of the reader for this document.



== Summary

//Summarize the motivation
//Summarize what was demonstrated
//Hint at other capabilities.
