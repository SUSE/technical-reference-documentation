== Introduction

=== Motivation

// Why this would be of interest
// Challenges
// Benefits

// TS: There is some good text here (https://medium.com/@olivier.borderies/jupyter-python-in-the-corporate-lan-109e2ffde897) to explain why JupyterLab.  We would just want to integrate in SLE value.

Introducing Machine Learning (ML) into a company strategy is exciting and has potential benefits to bring new information to customers.
But there are many technical challenges to implementing a successful ML stragegy.
Deploying and using the software tools on SLES and Rancher shouldn't be one of those challenges.
SUSE collaborates with Fujitsu to make this process easier to understand, repeatable, and transparent about preferred methods.

==== Why We Start with JupyterLab

You might be wondering why we don't just dive into an ML tookit in this document.
In one way, we think that we have.
Jupyter notebooks and JupyterLab are tools that help your company to share data, ideas, experiments and code.
Futhermore, Jupyter notebooks are self-documenting instructions that promote collaboration and automation of corporate processes in a uniform way.

=== Scope

This guide illustrates how to install, configure, and access JupyterLab on SUSE Linux Enterprise.
We believe that scientists and engineers working with machine learning tend to utilize leading-edge open-source tools.
With that in mind, we target SLES 15 SP4, as that is that latest operating system release.

This document will help you to successful deploy JupyterLab and to make sure you are ready to take the next steps in your Machine-Learning journey.
We feel that using Jupyter notebooks will help you with that journey and hope you come to see it in a similar way.


=== Audience

This guide is intended for developers, data scientists, machine-learning researchers, and others interested in leveraging the JupyterLab next generation, interactive, computational-notebook environment.
The deployment instructions in this document assume only an introductory understanding of Linux commands.
We hope to help you move quickly from concept to experimentation with the tools that you choose on SLES and Rancher.


== Prerequisites

// TS: Let's scrap the technical overview for this guide.  It doesn't seem helpful.  Instead, let's jump into prerequisites.

// Description
// TS: Perhaps, describe JupyterLab here, talk about how it's accessed through the web browser, and include a screenshot.
// TS: It probably wouldn't hurt to discuss that JupyterLab also supports other kernels besides Python, such as R and Julia, but I would recommend focusing only on iPython.

// Architecture diagram - TS: This doesn't seem necessary in this doc.  Use a screenshot of the interface instead.

// Minimum requirements (prerequisites) for this guide
// * Requirement 1 https://url[url]
// * Requirement 2 https://url[url]

// BF: I'm not sure how to expand on this list yet. I think I will come back to this later.
// Computer system - should we include any specs?
// > TS: I would be very general.  Perhaps, we drop the computer system from thelist, as it is obvious.
// Internet access - not much else to say, except maybe access to PyPI
// SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4 - we are specifically documenting SLES 15 SP4. SLED 15 SP4 and openSUSE Leap 15.4 or Tumbleweed would also work.


For this guide, you need:

* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4 or openSUSE 15.4.

** If you do not already have SLES, installation instructions can be found here:  https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/book-deployment.html

** Make sure your SLES installation is up-to-date by running `zypper patch *` or by using https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP4/html/SLES-all/cha-onlineupdate-you.html[YaST online update].

* Python3
+
Python 3.10 is included with SLES 15 SP4 and is used in this guide.

* Access to https://pypi.org/[The Python Package Index (PyPI)].
PyPI is a repository of software for the Python programming language.


== Setting up your Python environment

SLES 15 SP4 comes with Python 3.10 pre-installed.
This is adequate to run JupyterLab and many ML toolkits.
However, ML toolkits are in fast development and may have strict version dependencies.
To support multiple versions of Python as well as multiple versions of other dependencies in the Python and ML toolchain, you can create isolated, virtual environments.

=== Python Virtual Environment

The https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html[Python venv module] gives us a strong tool to isolation software dependencies.

Creating a Python virtual environment is easy.
Run the following commands as your user:

.Python 'venv' installation
[source,bash]
----
$ python3 -m venv $HOME/python3-ai
$ . $HOME/python3-ai/bin/activate
----


==== Python Pip Command

We will use the Python 'pip' command to install various Python tools.
To learn more about 'pip' please see: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/

Run the following commands as your user:

.Python 'pip' installation
[source,bash]
----
$ pip install --upgrade pip
----

.Advanced: Python System Versions:
****
Python itself may be a dependency for some of the machine learning toolkits you utilize.
For that reason, you might also consider the advanced topic of managing multiple versions of Python.
This would allow you to leverage the SLES-provided version, Python 3.6 for most tasks.
But, you would need an isolated environment in which to run a newer version of Python, such as Python 3.10.

TIP: For the tools we will introduce in our series of Getting Started Guides, Pythong 3.6 will be adequate.

If you decide that multiple versions of Python are required for your AI toolkits, please see:
https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv
****

==== Python Tool Versions and Dependencies

// TS: Create a Python virtual environment with the `venv` module and also include steps for saving the configuration with `pip freeze` for repeatable configurations.
// https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_freeze/
.Advanced: Python Tool Versions and Dependencies:
****
Python tools have dependencies on other Python components.
For that reason, you might also consider the advanced topic of managing the versions of your Python tools.
The idea is to capture your tool dependencies and be able to redeploy those later.
To do this, we would leverage one of two Python tools:  'pip freeze' or 'pipreqs'

Information about the use of 'pip freeze' can be found here: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_freeze/
Information about the use of 'pipreqs' can be found here: https://pypi.org/project/pipreqs/

TIP: You do not need to keep track of all your tool dependencies. You can always deploy a new virtual environment, if needed.
****

=== Install JupyterLab

Jupyter notebooks are a collaboration tool, typically used for science and computing domains.
JupyterLab is the latest web-based interactive development environment for notebooks, code, and data.
You can read more about JupyterLab here: https://jupyter.org/
Through JupyterLab, you can define workflows in data science, scientific computing, computational journalism, and machine learning.

To install JupyterLab, please make sure you have read and completed the prerequistes above.
Then, enter the following commands:


.JupyterLab installation
[source,bash]
----
$ pip install jupyterlab
----

// TS: We could also discuss `pipenv`: https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/.

Once installed, launch JupyterLab with:

.JupyterLab execution
[source,bash]
----
$ jupyter-lab
----

NOTE: This is where Brian left off

//Provide steps or link to existing document.
//[source, bash]
//---
//echo "Use code blocks for command-line steps."
//---

// TS: For installation, use https://jupyter.org/install as a guide.
// TS: Create a Python virtual environment with the `venv` module and also include steps for saving the configuration with `pip freeze` for repeatable configurations.
// TS: We could also discuss `pipenv`: https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/.
// TS: I would not introduce conda or mamba.
// TS: Oh, focus on Python3, not Python2.

== Use case and demonstration

//Describe use case and demonstration.

//[NOTE]
//====
// Use admonitions (i.e., NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, CAUTION, WARNING) as needed.
//====

//Use sections to break up major actions, such as:
//=== Prepare the demonstration environment (beyond installation)
//=== Perform action (to illustrate capability)
//=== Examine results (verifying capability)
//Use ordered lists for steps.
//Minimize/consolidate images whenever possible.

// TS: Take a look at https://coderefinery.github.io/jupyter/examples/ for some examples.  Let's keep the example here simple.  We're really focused on just getting JupyterLab with SLE into the mind of the reader for this document.
