1. Commands in bash shell segments that extend beyong page width get cut with a newline, so copy/paste fails.

2. Same formatting problems as #1 occur for Listing blocks, such as the Containerfile Listing.

3. Podman default install isn't configured correctly for regular user
   NEED:
    - Install SLES with ext4 filesystem for /home
    - Edit:  /etc/containers/storage.conf  --> driver="overlay"
    - See below

--storage-driver=value
Storage driver. The default storage driver for UID 0 is configured in /etc/containers/storage.conf ($HOME/.config/containers/storage.conf in rootless mode), and is vfs for non-root users when fuse-overlayfs is not available. The STORAGE_DRIVER environment variable overrides the default. The --storage-driver specified driver overrides all.

Overriding this option will cause the storage-opt settings in /etc/containers/storage.conf to be ignored. The user must specify additional options via the --storage-opt flag.

4. SUSE Connect permissions not set correctly (see below)

STEP 2/11: ENV ZYPPERCMD="zypper --non-interactive"
--> 16daf55c0df
STEP 3/11: RUN $ZYPPERCMD install python3 python3-pip
WARN[0007] error mounting subscriptions, skipping entry in /etc/containers/mounts.conf: open /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials: permission denied

STEP 4/11: RUN python3 -m venv /home/virtenv
WARN[0023] error mounting subscriptions, skipping entry in /etc/containers/mounts.conf: open /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials: permission denied

NOTE:  ^^^ one of these errors for every Containerfile RUN command!
NOTE:  The error (warning) below occurs when the container image is run

WARN[0000] error mounting subscriptions, skipping entry in /etc/containers/mounts.conf: open /etc/zypp/credentials.d/SCCcredentials: permission denied

5. Container cannot be removed, even though it appears to have terminated. $ podman ps  # no images running
   Error: Image used by 78c3e27471906fa363504ce37739dc251fd6bdf934cc95af72b4a5b82d03b83a: image is in use by a container
   FIX:  Need to use:  podman rmi ID -f
