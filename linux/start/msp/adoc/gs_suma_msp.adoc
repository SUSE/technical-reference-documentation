== Introduction

The Linux footprint of enterprise IT landscapes continues to grow.
This growth can be particularly problematic for a managed services provider (MSP), who may need to manage systems lifecycles for many clients.
As an MSP, you need a management tool that can scale with your business needs.

{product1_full} {product1_version} is an enterprise, open source management solution for software-defined infrastructure.
It is designed to help enterprises reduce complexity and regain control of IT assets with a single tool.
{product1} provides you with systems asset management, systems provisioning, and automated software management to help you keep all your systems up-to-date and secure.

{product1} easily scales to satisfy your technical and business requirements without compromising on operational performance.
It gives you the features and automation in a single tool to seamlessly manage a broad spectrum of Linux systems on a variety of hardware architectures and hypervisors as well as container, IoT, and cloud platforms.
With {product1}, you can manage systems lifecycle management, streamline operations, and manage your growing IT landscape.


=== Scope

You will learn how to deploy {product1} to support systems lifecycle management for multiple, downstream customers.
The hub and peripheral architecture described here enables managed services providers and large enterprises to consolidate certain management operations while maintaining the advantages of separate peripheral servers for each customer.


=== Audience

Platform engineers and systems administrators of managed services providers and large enterprises - who are responsible for delivering systems lifecycle management for multiple customers, organizations, or business units - will find useful guidance in this document.

You should have a basic familiarity with {product1} and with typical procedures for provisioning and patching Linux systems to get the most out of this document.


== Solution design

Managing a large and growing IT footprint can be a challenge for any enterprise.
Managed services providers (MSPs) must do this for multiple customers.
A single {product1} server could be used to manage all customer systems.
But there are key concerns with this approach, such as:

Scaling::
{product1} is designed as a single server that can manage up to 10000 clients.
An MSP with multiple large customers could reach this limit quickly.
To accommodate this, {product1} can be scaled horizontally by adding {product1} servers.

Separation of entitlements::
{product1} uses customer credentials to access software entitlements from upstream providers, such as the https://scc.suse.com/[SUSE Customer Center (SCC)].
It is not a good idea to mix the entitlements of multiple customers in a single environment, as it would be difficult to keep track of which managed systems are entitled to which products.

Access control and user isolation::
In situations where customers would expect access to {product1}, an MSP would need some way to isolate each customer’s users so they can only see and manage their own systems.
The MSP could install a dedicated {product1} server for each client.
This would address isolation, but it is somewhat inefficient because of the need to manage each of these servers independently.

{product1} empowers MSPs and large enterprises to address these concerns through:

* Content lifecycle management
* Hub and peripherals
* Inter-Server Synchronization

Each of these is discussed further below.


=== Content lifecycle management

Content lifecycle management involves creating clones of software channels at particular points in time and assigning these to different systems.
This is used to create multi-stage lifecycles where patches are passed from vendor channels to a development environment, from there to a test stage, and then to production.
MSPs can create separate lifecycles for each customer.
This ensures that each customer receives only the patches that are appropriate to its respective software lifecycle needs even though the patches may be based on the same upstream channels.


=== Hub and peripherals

https://{product1_docs}/specialized-guides/large-deployments/multi-server.html[{product1} Hub] was introduced to manage very large deployments by allowing horizontal scaling to multiple servers.

image::suma_msp_hub-architecture2.png[Hub and peripheral topology, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

In this hub and peripheral topology, one {product1} server acts as the central (or *hub*) server for one or more *peripheral* {product1} servers to which any number of client systems can be registered.
Each peripheral server is an independent {product1} server.
By dedicating a peripheral server for each customer, an MSP can address concerns about separation of customers while still allowing centralized control.

[NOTE]
====
Pay special attention to the security boundaries shown in the diagram above. End customers may have access to their own SUSE Manger servers if they wish. However, it is imperative that no customer be given access to the hub server because this server has control over all of the peripheral servers. A customer who was able to access this would be able to access other customers' systems.
====


For each peripheral server, you will need to create: activation keys, bootstrap, repositories, system groups, users, and so on. Similarly, any custom Salt states you create must be manually copied to the appropriate peripheral. 
SUSE provides a set of Salt modules, states, and formulas that can automate this process.

It is important to understand that the hub and peripheral concept was developed primarily to provide horizontal scaling. In this document, we are using it to provide isolation between systems and any benefits from scaling are incidental to this use case.



=== Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS)

With multiple {product1} servers in a hub and peripheral architecture, you need to ensure that content and permissions stay aligned.
https://{product1_docs}/administration/iss_v2.html#_install_iss_packages[Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS)] allows you to connect two or more {product1} servers and keep them up-to-date.
Since only the hub needs access to an external source (such as SCC), a side benefit is that peripheral servers do not require Internet access.


== Prerequisites

When sizing servers for {product1}, the most important variables are CPU, RAM, and disk storage.
Review https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/hardware-requirements.html[{product1} Hardware requirements] for recommendations.

For this guide, you need at least two systems.
These can be bare metal or virtual machines.
One will act as a hub server and the other will act as a peripheral server.
If you would like to explore registering a client to a peripheral server, add one more more systems to use as clients.

As the hub and peripheral servers will have very few clients, they do not need to follow normal sizing recommendations.
However, import and export operations involve a lot of SQL transactions and, potentially, significant storage for the database (located in `/var/lib/pgsql`).
The recommended configuration for both hub and peripheral servers is:

* CPU: 8 CPU cores
* RAM: 64 GB
* Storage: 100 GB
 
You will also need a way to transfer data between the hub and peripheral.
Ideally, this could be through a shared (NFS) filesystem, but you can also copy the data across the network (such as with `rsync`) or use a removable disk such as a USB storage device.


== Deployment

{product1} can be deployed onto bare metal or virtual machines, running on-premises or in cloud environments.

Once you have access to your target systems, you can proceed to install {product1}.


=== Create the hub server

At the center of the architecture is the {product1} hub server.
This server follows standard installation and setup processes.
However, for the hub server, you must enable the Hub XMLRPC API service service.


. Install {product1} on the designated hub system.
//
+
Follow the steps detailed in the https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade-overview.html[{product1} Installation and Upgrade Guide].

. Set up {product1}.
//
+
Follow the guidance in https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/server-setup.html[{product1} Server Setup], where you create your main administration account and organization.

. To make this a hub server, you need to install and enable the Hub XMLRPC API service.
+
[NOTE]
====
Commands shown here should be issued as the root user on the server.
====

.. On the hub server, install the `hub-xmlrpc-api` package.
//
+
The package is available in the {product1} repositories, so can be installed with a simple command.
+
[source, console]
----
zypper install hub-xmlrpc-api
----

.. Set the Hub XMLRPC API service to start automatically at boot time, and start it immediately:
+
[source, console]
----
systemctl enable hub-xmlrpc-api.service
systemctl start hub-xmlrpc-api.service
----
       
.. Check that these parameters in the `/etc/hub/hub.conf` configuration file are correct:
+
--

* HUB_API_URL: URL to the Hub Server XMLRPC API endpoint.
//
+
Use the default value.

* HUB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT: the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response when connecting to a Server.
//
+
Use the default value in most cases.

* HUB_REQUEST_TIMEOUT: the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response when calling a Server method.
//
+
Use the default value in most cases.

* HUB_CONNECT_USING_SSL: use HTTPS instead of HTTP for communicating with peripheral Servers.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using secure communications is recommended.

To use HTTPS to connect to peripheral servers, you must:

. Set the HUB_CONNECT_USING_SSL parameter to `true`

. Ensure that the SSL certificates for all the peripheral servers are installed on the hub server.
//
+
Do this by copying the RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT certificate file from each peripheral server’s `http://<server-url>/pub/` directory to `/etc/pki/trust/anchors/`, then run `update-ca-certificates`.

====

--

.. Restart services to activate any configuration changes you make.
+
[source, console]
----
sudo systemctl restart hub-xmlrpc-api.service
----


=== Onboard a customer

Onboarding a new customer begins with adding the customer's SUSE Customer Center (SCC) credentials to the hub server. This gives you centralized access to the products they have subscribed to because 
SUSE Manager merges products coming from all SCC credentials. Alternatively, if the Service provider is using their own subscriptions to provide access under an MSP agreement with SUSE, then only that subscription needs to be added on the hub.

image::suma_msp_orgcreds.png[Adding Organization Credentials, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

This gives you a centralized view of all products that are available through the hub and enables replication of entitlements from the hub to peripheral servers.

image::suma_msp_products.png[Synchronizing Products, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

Follow https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/server-setup.html#_synchronizing_products_from_suse_customer_center[Synchronizing Products from SUSE Customer Center] to onboard a customer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To properly synchronize content lifecycle channels later, do not create a separate organization for each new customer.
====


=== Create a peripheral server

Peripheral servers are {product1} servers you can dedicate to a customer.
Creating a peripheral server follows the normal {product1} installation and setup processes.
However, instead of configuring the SCC connection, you configure the peripheral server to obtain SCC content from the hub.

. Install {product1} on the designated hub system.
//
+
Follow the steps detailed in the https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade-overview.html[{product1} Installation and Upgrade Guide].

. Set up {product1}.
//
+
Follow the guidance in https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/server-setup.html[{product1} Server Setup].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Your main administration user and organization should match those you created on the hub server. This is so that the later Inter-Server Synchronization of content will work correctly. This limitation may be removed in a future version of {product1}.
====


=== Register the peripheral server

Peripheral servers must be registered to the hub server as Salt clients.
When you register a peripheral server, you must assign it to the appropriate {product1} software channel as its base channel.
The best way to do this is with activation keys.
You can create a specific activation key and assign the appropriate channel as the base channel based on the key.

Register a peripheral server to the hub using one of the https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/registration-methods.html[Client Registration Methods].

[Note]
====
You may want to create an Activation Key specifically for peripheral servers, expecially if you will also have other types of client registered to your hub.
====

For example, to register a peripheral with the {product1} Web UI, you can follow these steps:

. In the {product1} Web UI, navigate to __Systems__ > __Bootstrapping__.

. In the __Host__ field, type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the client to be bootstrapped.

. In the __SSH Port__ field, type the SSH port number (by default, this is port 22) to use to connect and bootstrap the client.

. In the __User__ field, type the username to log in to the client.
//
+
By default, the username is `root`.

. To bootstrap the client with SSH, in the __Authentication__ field, check __SSH Private Key__, and upload the SSH private key to use.
//
+
If your SSH private key requires a passphrase, type it into the __SSH Private Key Passphrase__ field.

. To bootstrap the client with a password, in the __Authentication__ field, check __Password__, and type the client password.

. In the __Activation Key__ field, select the activation key that is associated with the peripheral servers. 

. By default, the __Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking__ checkbox is selected.
//
+
This allows the bootstrap process to automatically accept SSH host keys without requiring you to manually authenticate each one.

. Check the __Manage System Completely via SSH__ checkbox.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you check this option, the client is configured to use SSH for its connection to the server, and no other connection method is configured.
====

. Click __Bootstrap__ to begin registration.

image::suma_msp_bootstrap.png[Bootstrapping a peripheral, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

When the bootstrap process has completed, your client is listed at __Systems__ > __System List__.
The peripheral server can now be managed as a standard Salt client of the hub and patche din teh normal way. 


== Synchronizing content

=== Install Inter-Server Synchronization

To use Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS), you need to install the `inter-server-sync` package on hub and peripheral {product1} servers.
This is easily accomplished by issuing the following command:

[source, console]
----
zypper install inter-server-sync
----

=== Build customer-specific content lifecycle management

As an MSP, you manage the systems lifecycles of many customers.
Managing the testing and roll out of software packages to your customers can be challenging.
Moreover, your customers may have each have different software needs, testing requirements, and deployment schedules.
{product1} provides the flexibility you need to define and manage content lifecycles for your business and your customers.

You begin by creating customer-specific software channels and assigning these to appropriate, managed clients. For example, let's suppose we have a customer called ACME Corp. We can create a Content Lifecycle Project just for them. 

. In the {product1} Web UI, navigate to __Content Lifecycle__ > __Projects__.

. Click on __Create Project__

. In the __Name__ field, type a name for this project.

. In the __Label__ field, type the name that will be used internally.

. In the __Description__ field, you can add a more verbose explanation.

image::suma_msp_newclm.png[Creating a new CLM project, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

You can now proceed to build the CLM for this customer in the usual manner by adding sources and environemnts in the usual manner. To learn more, see https://{product1_docs}/administration/content-lifecycle.html[Content Lifecycle Management].

image::suma_msp_clmbuild.png[Creating a new CLM environment, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

=== Export and import content

After defining customer-specific channels as part of your content lifecycle management, you can use the `inter-server-sync` command to export these channels from the {product1} hub to a local filesystem directory.
For example, here we export the dev environment from a customer's CLM to an NFS export mounted at /mnt/shared on the hub server. Note that this command can take a considerable time to run and is very CPU intensive. It copies all of the required packages and creates all of the SQL commands needed to recreate the channel structure and contents on the importing server.

[source, console]
----
suma-hub:/mnt/shared # inter-server-sync export --channel-with-children acmecorp-acmedev-sle15sp4-sle-product-sles15-sp4-pool-x86_64 

suma-hub:/mnt/shared # ll
total 457384
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       540 Jul 11 13:38 exportedChannels.txt
drwxr-x--- 1 root root         8 Jul 11 13:03 packages
-rw------- 1 root root 468349180 Jul 11 13:38 sql_statements.sql.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root        44 Jul 11 13:38 version.txt
----

[TIP]
====
Get detailed help on the ISS export command with `inter-server-sync export -h`.
====


When the export is complete, you need to transfer the directory and its contents to the peripheral server.

Next, you can import the content lifecycle management on the peripheral server. Fro example, here we import the channel we exported above from an NFS export mounted on the peripheral server.

[source, console]
----
suma-peripheral:/mnt/shared # inter-server-sync import 
----

Notice that there is no need to specify channel names because that is impicit in the SQL statements. You simply need to refer to the directory that contains the exported content and that is the current directory by default.

[TIP]
====
Get detailed help on the ISS import command with `inter-server-sync import -h`.
====


=== Registering clients

Clients are the end-point systems you want to manage.
{product1} is compatible with a wide range of client technologies.
For a full list supported clients and features, see https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/supported-features.html[Supported Clients and Features].

There are three ways to register clients to a {product1} server:

* https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/registration-webui.html[through the Web UI]

* https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/registration-bootstrap.html[with a bootstrap script]

* https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/registration-bootstrap.html[on the command line (Salt)]

For bootstrap and command line methods, you must first create an https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/activation-keys.html[activation key].

[IMPORTANT]
====
For all methods, date and time on the client must be synchronized with the {product1} server.
====

For details on client configuration, see the https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/client-config-overview.html[Client Configuration Guide].



== Centralized management

// Mark: Add some verbiage and link to more documentation here.

=== Salt modules and formulas

Management of users, system groups, activation keys, and so on.
Salt states are defined on the hub level and can be applied to the peripheral servers. 

Activation keys make reference to channels so you need to import the appropriate content first.

Salt uses execution and state modules to define, apply, and orchestrate configuration of your devices. Uyuni provides a set of modules called Uyuni configuration modules, that you can use to configure both SUSE Manager and Uyuni Servers.

You can use the Uyuni configuration modules directly or using SLS files. They are are especially useful if you have multiple Uyuni Servers, for example in Hub installations, but they are also useful for smaller installations.

You can use Uyuni configuration modules to configure:

* Organizations
* Users
* User permissions
* System groups
* Activation Keys

The Uyuni configuration modules are available in the uyuni-config-modules package. On the SUSE Manager Hub Server, at the command prompt, as root, use this command to install them:

[source, console]
----
zypper in uyuni-config-modules
----

This package also installs detailed API descriptions, indications on pillar settings, and examples. When you have installed the package, navigate to /usr/share/doc/packages/uyuni-config-modules/


=== Hub API

The Hub XMLRPC API allows you to control all of the peripheral servers programmatically from the hub. It operates in a similar way to the standard SUSE Manager API. https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/api/suse-manager/index.html

Make sure the hub-xmlrpc-api service is started:

[source, console]
----
systemctl start hub-xmlrpc-api
----

Once the service is running, you can connect to the service at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries. The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types. Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some Hub-specific end points which are not available in the SUSE Manager API.

The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces:

* The hub namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server itself. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication.
* The unicast namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API endpoint was used directly.
* The multicast namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub. It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map.
 

=== Reporting

Every {product1} peripheral server has its own reporting (PostgreSQL) database, where information is collected for that server and its registered clients.
The {product1} hub server aggregates and stores information collected from all the peripheral servers in its own reporting database.
This provides the MSP easy access to data from all clients under management.

{product1} allows for the production of various reports.
MSPs can leverage reports for a variety of tasks, such as taking inventory of subscribed systems, users, and organizations.
You can leverage some of the pre-configured reports or use an external reporting tool to create fully customized reports.

[TIP]
====
Connect to an external reporting tool only through a user account with read-only permissions.
====

For more on reporting, see https://{product1_docs}/administration/reports.html[Reports Generation].
