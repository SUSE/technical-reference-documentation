== Introduction

The Linux footprint of enterprise IT landscapes continues to grow.
This growth can be particularly problematic for managed services providers (MSPs), who may need to manage systems lifecycles for many clients.
As an MSP, you need a management tool that can scale with your business needs.

{product1_full} {product1_version} is an enterprise, open source management solution for software-defined infrastructure.
It is designed to help enterprises reduce complexity and regain control of IT assets with a single tool.
{product1} provides you with systems asset management, systems provisioning, and automated software management to help you keep all your systems up-to-date and secure.

{product1} easily scales to satisfy your technical and business requirements without compromising on operational performance.
It gives you the features and automation in a single tool. Thus, you can seamlessly manage a broad spectrum of Linux systems on a variety of hardware architectures and hypervisors, and container, IoT, and cloud platforms.
With {product1}, you can manage systems lifecycle management, streamline operations, and manage your growing IT landscape.


=== Scope

You will learn how to deploy {product1} to support systems lifecycle management for multiple, downstream customers.
The hub and peripheral architecture described here enables managed services providers and large enterprises to consolidate certain management operations while maintaining the advantages of separate peripheral servers for each customer.


=== Audience

Platform engineers and systems administrators of MSPs and large enterprises - who are responsible for delivering systems lifecycle management for multiple customers, organizations, or business units - will find useful guidance in this document.

You should have a basic familiarity with {product1} and with typical procedures for provisioning and patching Linux systems to get the most out of this document.


=== Prerequisites

For this guide, you need at least two systems.
These can be bare metal or virtual machines.
These will be your {product1} hub and peripheral servers.
If you want to explore registering client systems for management, add one or more additional systems.

For this guide, the recommended configuration for each server is:

* CPU: 8 CPU cores
* RAM: 64 GB
* Storage: 100 GB

[IMPORTANT]
====
For a typical production deployment, be sure to review https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/hardware-requirements.html[{product1} Hardware requirements].

When sizing servers for {product1}, the most important variables are CPU, RAM, and disk storage.
This can be critical when implementing the hub and peripheral solution for the real world.
Import and export operations involve a lot of SQL transactions, which can be CPU and memory intensive.
And, you can have significant storage requirements for the database (located in `/var/lib/pgsql`), depending on the size and complexity of your IT landscape.

SUSE offers https://www.suse.com/services/[Consulting Services] that can help you assess your needs and provide proper sizing recommendations.
====

Additionally, you need a way to transfer data between the servers.
Ideally, this could be through a shared (NFS) file system, but you can also copy the data across the network (such as with `rsync`) or use a removable disk such as a USB storage device.



== Solution design

Managing a large and growing IT footprint can be a challenge for any enterprise.
Managed services providers (MSPs) must do this for multiple customers.
A single {product1} server could be used to manage all customer systems.
But there are key concerns with this approach, such as:

Scaling::
{product1} is designed as a single server that can manage up to 10000 clients.
An MSP with multiple large customers could reach this limit quickly.
To accommodate this, {product1} can be scaled horizontally by adding {product1} servers.

Separation of entitlements::
{product1} uses customer credentials to access software entitlements from upstream providers, such as the https://scc.suse.com/[SUSE Customer Center (SCC)].
It is not a good idea to mix the entitlements of multiple customers in a single environment, as it would be difficult to keep track of which managed systems are entitled to which products.

Access control and user isolation::
In situations where customers would expect access to {product1}, an MSP would need some way to isolate each customer’s users so they can only see and manage their own systems.
The MSP could install a dedicated {product1} server for each client.
This would address isolation, but it is somewhat inefficient because of the need to manage each of these servers independently.

{product1} empowers MSPs and large enterprises to address these concerns through:

* Content lifecycle management
* Hub and peripherals
* Inter-Server Synchronization

Each of these is discussed further below.


=== Content lifecycle management

Content lifecycle management involves creating clones of software channels at particular points in time and assigning these to different systems.
This is used to create multi-stage lifecycles where patches are passed from vendor channels to a development environment, from there to a test stage, and then to production.
MSPs can create separate lifecycles for each customer.
This ensures that each customer receives only the patches that are appropriate to its respective software lifecycle needs even though the patches may be based on the same upstream channels.


=== Hub and peripherals

https://{product1_docs}/specialized-guides/large-deployments/multi-server.html[{product1} Hub] was introduced to manage very large deployments by allowing horizontal scaling to multiple servers.

image::suma_msp_hub-architecture2.png[Hub and peripheral topology, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

In this hub and peripheral topology, one {product1} server acts as the central (or *hub*) server for one or more *peripheral* {product1} servers. Any number of client systems can be registered to the server.
Each peripheral server is an independent {product1} server.
By dedicating a peripheral server for each customer, an MSP can address concerns about separation of customers while still allowing centralized control.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Pay special attention to the security boundaries shown in the diagram above.
End customers may have access to their own {product1} servers if they want.
However, it is imperative that no customer be given access to the hub server because this server has control over all of the peripheral servers.
A customer who can access the hub would be able to access other customers' systems.
====

For each peripheral server, you need to create activation keys, bootstrap, repositories, system groups, users, and so on.
Similarly, any custom Salt states you create must be manually copied to the appropriate peripheral.
SUSE provides a set of Salt modules, states, and formulas that can automate this process.

It is important to understand that the hub and peripheral concept was developed primarily to provide horizontal scaling.
For this guide, it is being used to provide isolation between systems and any benefits from scaling are incidental to this use case.



=== Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS)

With multiple {product1} servers in a hub and peripheral architecture, you need to ensure that content and permissions stay aligned.
https://{product1_docs}/administration/iss_v2.html#_install_iss_packages[Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS)] allows you to connect two or more {product1} servers and keep them up-to-date.
Since only the hub needs access to an external source (such as SCC), a side benefit is that peripheral servers do not require Internet access.



== Creating the hub server

At the center of the architecture is the {product1} hub server.
This server follows standard installation and setup processes.
{product1} can be deployed onto bare metal or virtual machines, running on-premises or in cloud environments.
However, for the hub server, you must also enable the Hub XMLRPC API service.


. Install {product1} on the designated hub system.
//
+
Follow the steps detailed in the https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade-overview.html[{product1} Installation and Upgrade Guide].

. Set up {product1}.
//
+
Follow the guidance in https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/server-setup.html[{product1} Server Setup], where you create your main administration account and organization.

. To make this a hub server, you need to install and enable the Hub XMLRPC API service.
+
[NOTE]
====
Commands shown here should be issued as the root user on the server.
====

.. On the hub server, install the `hub-xmlrpc-api` package.
//
+
The package is available in the {product1} repositories, so can be installed with a simple command.
+
[source, console]
----
zypper install hub-xmlrpc-api
----

.. Set the Hub XMLRPC API service to start automatically at boot time, and start it immediately:
+
[source, console]
----
systemctl enable hub-xmlrpc-api.service
systemctl start hub-xmlrpc-api.service
----

.. Check that these parameters in the `/etc/hub/hub.conf` configuration file are correct:
+
--

* HUB_API_URL: URL to the Hub Server XMLRPC API endpoint.
//
+
Use the default value.

* HUB_CONNECT_TIMEOUT: the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response when connecting to a Server.
//
+
Use the default value in most cases.

* HUB_REQUEST_TIMEOUT: the maximum number of seconds to wait for a response when calling a Server method.
//
+
Use the default value in most cases.

* HUB_CONNECT_USING_SSL: use HTTPS instead of HTTP for communicating with peripheral Servers.
+
[NOTE]
====
Using secure communications is recommended.

To use HTTPS to connect to peripheral servers, you must:

. Set the HUB_CONNECT_USING_SSL parameter to `true`

. Ensure that the SSL certificates for all the peripheral servers are installed on the hub server.
//
+
Do this by copying the RHN-ORG-TRUSTED-SSL-CERT certificate file from each peripheral server’s "http://<server-url>/pub/" directory to `/etc/pki/trust/anchors/`, then run `update-ca-certificates`.

====

--

.. Restart services to activate any configuration changes you make.
+
[source, console]
----
systemctl restart hub-xmlrpc-api.service
----


== Onboarding a customer

To onboard a new customer, you start by adding the customer's SUSE Customer Center (SCC) credentials to the hub server.
You do this for each customer.
Then {product1} can provide you with centralized access to all subscribed products.

Alternatively, if you (as the service provider) are using your own subscriptions to provide access under an MSP agreement with SUSE, then you only need to add that subscription to the hub.

image::suma_msp_orgcreds.png[Adding Organization Credentials, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

When the SCC credentials have been added, you have a centralized view of all products that are available through the hub and the ability to replicate entitlements from the hub to peripheral servers.

image::suma_msp_products.png[Synchronizing Products, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

Follow https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/server-setup.html#_synchronizing_products_from_suse_customer_center[Synchronizing Products from SUSE Customer Center] to onboard a customer.

[IMPORTANT]
====
To properly synchronize content lifecycle channels later, do not create a separate organization for each new customer.
====


== Creating a peripheral server

Peripheral servers are {product1} servers you can dedicate to a customer.
Creating a peripheral server follows the normal {product1} installation and setup processes.
However, instead of configuring the SCC connection, you configure the peripheral server to obtain SCC content from the hub.

. Install {product1} on the designated hub system.
//
+
Follow the steps detailed in the https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/installation-and-upgrade-overview.html[{product1} Installation and Upgrade Guide].

. Set up {product1}.
//
+
Follow the guidance in https://{product1_docs}/installation-and-upgrade/server-setup.html[{product1} Server Setup].
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Your main administration user and organization should match those you created on the hub server.
This enables Inter-Server Synchronization of content to work correctly.
This limitation may be removed in a future version of {product1}.
====


== Registering a peripheral server

Peripheral servers must be registered to the hub server as Salt clients.
When you register a peripheral server, you must assign it to the appropriate {product1} software channel as its base channel.
The best way to do this is with activation keys.
You can create a specific activation key and assign the appropriate channel as the base channel with the key.

Register a peripheral server to the hub using one of the https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/registration-methods.html[Client Registration Methods].

[NOTE]
====
You should create an activation key specifically for peripheral servers, especially if you will have other types of clients registered to your hub.
====

To register a peripheral with the {product1} Web UI, you can follow these steps:

. In the {product1} Web UI, navigate to __Systems__ > __Bootstrapping__.

. In the __Host__ field, type the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the client to be bootstrapped.

. In the __SSH Port__ field, type the SSH port number to use to connect to and bootstrap the client.
//
+
The default SSH port number is `22`.

. In the __User__ field, type the user name to log in to the client.
//
+
The default user name is `root`.

. To bootstrap the client with SSH, in the __Authentication__ field, check __SSH Private Key__, and upload the SSH private key to use.
//
+
If your SSH private key requires a passphrase, type it into the __SSH Private Key Passphrase__ field.

. To bootstrap the client with a password, in the __Authentication__ field, check __Password__, and type the client password.

. In the __Activation Key__ field, select the activation key that is associated with the peripheral servers.

. __Disable SSH Strict Key Host Checking__ is selected by default.
//
+
This allows the bootstrap process to automatically accept SSH host keys without requiring you to manually authenticate each one.

. Check the __Manage System Completely via SSH__ check box.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you select this option, the client is configured to use SSH for its connection to the server, and no other connection method is configured.
====

. Click __Bootstrap__ to begin registration.

image::suma_msp_bootstrap.png[Bootstrapping a peripheral, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

When the bootstrap process has completed, your client is listed in the Web UI at __Systems__ > __System List__.
The peripheral server can now be managed as a standard Salt client of the hub and patched in the normal way.


== Synchronizing content

You need to ensure that your {product1} servers stay aligned on content.
This is accomplished using Inter-Server Synchronization.


=== Installing Inter-Server Synchronization

To use Inter-Server Synchronization (ISS), you need to install the `inter-server-sync` package on hub and peripheral {product1} servers.

Do this by issuing the following command on each server:

[source, console]
----
zypper install inter-server-sync
----


=== Building customer-specific content lifecycle management


Content lifecycle management (CLM) allows you to customize and test software before deploying to production systems.
As an MSP, each of your customers may have different software needs, testing requirements, and deployment schedules.
It can be quite challenging to manage CLM for all of your customers.

{product1} provides the flexibility you need to define and manage content lifecycles for your business and your customers.
You begin by creating customer-specific software channels.
These are then assigned to appropriate, managed clients.

For example, suppose you have a customer called ACME Corp.
You can create a Content Lifecycle Project only for this customer as follows:

. In the {product1} Web UI, navigate to __Content Lifecycle__ > __Projects__.

. Click __Create Project__

. In the __Name__ field, type a name for this project.

. In the __Label__ field, type the name that will be used internally.

. In the __Description__ field, you can add a more verbose explanation.

image::suma_msp_newclm.png[Creating a new CLM project, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

You can now proceed to build the CLM for this customer in the usual manner by adding sources and environments in the usual manner. To learn more, see https://{product1_docs}/administration/content-lifecycle.html[Content Lifecycle Management].

image::suma_msp_clmbuild.png[Creating a new CLM environment, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]


=== Exporting and importing content

After defining customer-specific channels as part of your content lifecycle management (CLM), use the `inter-server-sync` command to export these channels from the {product1} hub to a directory.
This directory and its contents needs to be transferred to the peripheral server.
The easiest way to do this is to use a shared file system.

The example below shows how to export the development environment from the ACME Corp customer's CLM to an NFS file system mounted at `/mnt/shared` on the hub and peripheral servers.

[NOTE]
====
Exporting can take considerable time to run and is very CPU intensive.
It copies all of the required packages and creates all of the SQL commands needed to recreate the channel structure and contents on the importing server.
====

. Export the CLM on the hub server.

.. On the hub server command line, change to the shared directory.
+
[source, console]
----
cd /mnt/shared
----

.. Initiate the export.
+
[source, console]
----
inter-server-sync export --channel-with-children acmecorp-acmedev-sle15sp4-sle-product-sles15-sp4-pool-x86_64
----
+
[TIP]
====
The `inter-server-sync export` command outputs to the current directory by default.
You could specify an output directory with the `--outputDir` flag.
Get detailed help on the export command with `inter-server-sync export -h`.
====

.. Verify that the export succeeded by viewing the contents of the directory.
+
[source, console]
----
ls -l
----
+
[listing]
----
total 457384
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root       540 Jul 11 13:38 exportedChannels.txt
drwxr-x--- 1 root root         8 Jul 11 13:03 packages
-rw------- 1 root root 468349180 Jul 11 13:38 sql_statements.sql.gz
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root        44 Jul 11 13:38 version.txt
----

. Import the CLM on the peripheral server.

.. On the peripheral server command line, change to the shared directory.
+
[source, console]
----
cd /mnt/shared
----

.. Initiate the import.
+
[source, console]
----
inter-server-sync import
----
+
[TIP]
====
Get detailed help on the ISS import command with `inter-server-sync import -h`.
====
+
[NOTE]
====
There is no need to specify channel names because that is implicit in the SQL statements.
You simply need to refer to the directory that contains the exported content and, by default, that is the current directory.
====


== Registering clients

Clients are the end-point systems you want to manage.
{product1} is compatible with a wide range of client technologies.
For a full list supported clients and features, see https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/supported-features.html[Supported Clients and Features].

There are three ways to register clients to a {product1} server:

* https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/registration-webui.html[through the Web UI]

* https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/registration-bootstrap.html[with a bootstrap script]

* https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/registration-bootstrap.html[on the command line (Salt)]

For bootstrap and command line methods, you must first create an https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/activation-keys.html[activation key].

[IMPORTANT]
====
For all methods, date and time on the client must be synchronized with the {product1} server.
====

For details on client configuration, see the https://{product1_docs}/client-configuration/client-config-overview.html[Client Configuration Guide].



== Working with Salt modules and formulas

Salt is a remote execution engine, configuration management, and orchestration system used by SUSE Manager.
Salt uses execution and state modules to define, apply, and orchestrate configuration of your devices.
You use Salt states to manage users, system groups, activation keys, and so on.

SUSE Manager provides a set of modules called Uyuni configuration modules, that you can use to configure both SUSE Manager and https://www.uyuni-project.org/[Uyuni] Servers.
You can use the Uyuni configuration modules and create your own custom Salt State (SLS) files.
Salt states are defined on the hub level and can be applied to the peripheral servers.


[IMPORTANT]
====
Activation keys make reference to channels, so you need to import appropriate content first.
====

You can use Uyuni configuration modules to configure:

* Organizations
* Users
* User permissions
* System groups
* Activation Keys

The Uyuni configuration modules are available in the `uyuni-config-modules` package.
Install this package on the {product1} hub server by logging in as root and issuing the command:

[source, console]
----
zypper in uyuni-config-modules
----

This package also installs detailed API descriptions, indications on pillar settings, and examples.
You can find these in `/usr/share/doc/packages/uyuni-config-modules/`.



=== Understanding the Hub XMLRPC API namespaces

The https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/specialized-guides/large-deployments/hub-namespaces.html[Hub XMLRPC API] allows you to control all of the peripheral servers programmatically from the hub.
It operates in a similar way to the standard https://{product1_docs_api}/index.html[{product1} API].


In <<Creating the hub server>>, you installed the `hub-xmlrpc-api` package and enabled and started the service.
With the service running, you can connect to it at port 2830 using any XMLRPC-compliant client libraries.

Verify that the service is running on your hub server.
[source, console]
----
systemctl status hub-xmlrpc-api.service
----


The Hub XMLRPC API exposes the same methods that are available from the server’s XMLRPC API, with a few differences in parameter and return types.
Additionally, the Hub XMLRPC API supports some hub-specific end points which are not available in the SUSE Manager API.

The Hub XMLRPC API supports three different namespaces:

* The `hub` namespace is used to target the Hub XMLRPC API Server itself. It supports Hub-specific XMLRPC endpoints which are primarily related to authentication.

* The `unicast` namespace is used to target a single server registered in the hub.
It redirects any call transparently to one specific server and returns any value as if the server’s XMLRPC API end point was used directly.

* The `multicast` namespace is used to target multiple peripheral servers registered in the hub.
It redirects any call transparently to all the specified servers and returns the results in the form of a map.

See the https://documentation.suse.com/suma/4.3/en/suse-manager/index.html[{product1} documentation}] for further details.



=== Reporting

Every {product1} peripheral server has its own reporting (PostgreSQL) database, where information is collected for that server and its registered clients.
The hub server aggregates and stores information collected from all the peripheral servers in its own reporting database.
This gives you easy access to data from all clients under management.

{product1} provides some preconfigured reports that you can leverage for a variety of tasks, such as taking inventory of subscribed systems, users, and organizations.
You can also use an external reporting tool to create fully customized reports.

[TIP]
====
Connect to an external reporting tool only through a user account with read-only permissions.
====

For more on reporting, see https://{product1_docs}/administration/reports.html[Reports Generation].
