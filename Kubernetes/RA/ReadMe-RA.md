# Leverage main [README.md](./README.md) sections
- Content
- Output Creation
- Content Modification / Validation / Submission

# Reference Architecture variant
- At this point, you can now start editing the configuration/structure/content to to the reference enterprise architecture approach
  - NOTE: every portion of text that cites "FixMe" is a flag to encourage modification
  - in the top-level directory
    - for the default configuration/structure (chapter/section/sub-section)
      - review the DAPS configuration templatee [TRD-Kubernetes-RA](./TRD-Kubernetes-RA)
        - verify the global ADOC_ATTRIBUTES+=" --attribute RA=1" line is uncommentd to toggle to this variant
          - then re-do the above validation step to generate the target output
        - as needed/desired, also review/edit the same section's set of ADOC_ATTRIBUTES to match what content you with to provide
  - in the main "adoc" directory
    - review the [adoc/SA.adoc](./adoc/SA.adoc) main file that pulls in the selected sections
      - if the respective ADOC_ATTRIBUTES value is set (value = 1 and uncommented) in the DAPS config file, then the conditional "ifdef" will include that content in the output
    - review/edit the [adoc/SA_vars.adoc](./adoc/SA_vars.adoc) file to change global variable settings, like
      - companyName
      - title (relative to your attribute setting)
      - github references
    - review/edit the general sections, that are generally included
      - Summary : [adoc/SA-Summary.adoc](./adoc/SA-Summary.adoc)
    - review/edit the general sections, that your ADOC_ATTRIBUTES settings will include
      - References : [adoc/SA-References.adoc](./adoc/SA-References.adoc)
      - Glossary : [adoc/SA-Glossary.adoc](./adoc/SA-Glossary.adoc)
      - Appendices : [adoc/SA-Appendix.adoc](./adoc/SA-Appendix.adoc)
      - Legal Notice + Document License
    - the corresponding layers of an enterprise architecture, which correspond to the suggested chapters, as noted below
      - RA-Introduction  : [adoc/i/SA.adoc](./adoc/i/SA.adoc)
      - RA-BusinessProblemBusinessValue (BPBV) : 2/ii [adoc/ii/SA-RA-BPBV.adoc](./adoc/ii/SA-RA-BPBV.adoc)
      - RA-Requirements : 3/iii [adoc/iii/SA-RA-Requirements.adoc](./adoc/iii/SA-RA-Requirements.adoc)
      - RA-ArchitectureOverview : 4/iv [adoc/iv/SA-RA-ArchOv.adoc](./adoc/iv/SA-RA-ArchOv.adoc)
      - RA-ComponentModel (CompMod) : 5/v [adoc/v/SA-RA-CompMod.adoc](./adoc/v/SA-RA-CompMod.adoc)
      - RA-Deployment : 6/vi [adoc/vi/SA-RA-Deployment.adoc](./adoc/vi/SA-RA-Deployment.adoc)
      - in each of these chapters' directories, you will notice the main SA.doc references, via ifdef, and will utilize the alternative file content from SA-RA-layerName.adoc and more modules of content.
        - so you typically don't need to edit/touch each chapter's SA.adoc
    - review/edit the chapter/section/sub-section content, that you wish to include
  - miscellaneous 
    - you can also add images/media content as needed in those subdirectories
    - do not forget to check in your iterations as well to have a source repository and ability to rollback to a known working state
