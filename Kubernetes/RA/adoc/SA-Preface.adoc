ifdef::focusK3s[]
:preface: {preface} {pn_K3s_ProductPage}[{pn_K3s}], an official CNCF sandbox project that delivers a lightweight yet powerful certified Kubernetes distribution designed for production workloads across resource-restrained, remote locations or on Edge IoT devices.

ifdef::focusRKE1[]
:preface: {preface} {pn_RKE1_ProductPage}[{pn_RKE1}] ( {an_RKE1} ), a Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within containers on bare-metal and virtualized nodes. {an_RKE1} solves the problem of installation complexity and the operation is both simplified and easily automated, while entirely accommodating the operating system and platform it is running on.

ifdef::focusRKE2[]
:preface: {preface} pn_RKE2_ProductPage}[{pn_RKE2}] ( {an_RKE2} ), a Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within containers on bare-metal and virtualized nodes. {an_RKE2} solves the problem of installation complexity and the operation is both simplified and easily automated, while entirely accommodating the operating system and platform it is running on. Also being a hardened, FIPS-enabled version, it adopts a compliance-based approach towards security, targeting standard risk management frameworks and best practices with the goal of stronger defense for cloud-native apps.
