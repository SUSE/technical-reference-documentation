The figure below illustrates the high-level architecture of {pn_K3s}:

image::ArchitectureOverview-{pn_K3s}.png[title="FixMe - Architecture Overview - {pn_K3s}", scaledwidth=80%]

Container Runtime::
Containerd & runc
Kine as a datastore shim that allows etcd to be replaced with other databases

Networking::
Flannel for CNI 
Kube-router for network policy

Services::
CoreDNS
Metrics Server
Traefik for ingress
Klipper-lb as an embedded service loadbalancer provider
Local-path-provisioner for provisioning volumes using local storage

Workloads::
Helm-controller to allow for CRD-driven deployment of helm manifests

Host utilities::
iptables/nftables, ebtables, ethtool, & socat

Once setup, users can potentially interact with {pn_K3s}
FixMe - through the web-based user interface (UI), the command-line interface ( CLI ), and programatically through the application programming interface ( API ). Depending upon the assigned roles, group membership and privileges, a user could:

* kubectl 
** directly on the {pn_K3s} host or
** remotely, leveraging the KUBECONFIG file of the {pn_K3s) cluster's deployment ( FixMe )
* manual or automatic, Manifest or Helm Chart based, workload deployments

// ifdef::RC,RI[]
// FixMe - For the best performance and security, the recommended deployment is a dedicated Kubernetes cluster for the {pn_Rancher} management server. Running user workloads on this cluster is not advised. After deploying {pn_Rancher}, one can then create or import clusters for orchestrated workloads.

To aid in planning, training or assessing functionality like in a <<G_PoC>> deployment, {pn_K3s} can be installed on a single node running a Linux operating system as described later in this document.

ifdef::BP[]
TIP: To improve <<G_Availability>>, the {pn_K3s) solution can leverage <<G_Scaling>> to nodes with different roles ( server, agent ) and with a shared datastore ( embedded etcd or external etd, MariaDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL ) from the single node to a <<G_Production>> installation on a multi-node, high-availability Kubernetes cluster.
