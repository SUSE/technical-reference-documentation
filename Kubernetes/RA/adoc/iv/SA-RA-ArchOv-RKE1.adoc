The figure below illustrates the high-level architecture of {pn_RKE1}:

image::ArchitectureOverview-RKE1.png[title="Architecture Overview - {pn_RKE1}", scaledwidth=80%]

FixMe-Authentication Proxy::
A user is authenticated via {pn_RKE1} and then, if authorized, can access both the {pn_RKE1} environment and the downstream clusters and workloads.

FixMe-API Server::
This provides the programmatic interface backend for user, command-line interactions with {pn_RKE1} and the managed clusters.

FixMe-Data Store::
The purpose of this service is to capture the configuration and state of {pn_RKE1} and the managed clusters to aid in backup and recovery processes.

FixMe-Cluster Controller::
Interacting with a cluster agent on the downstream cluster, the cluster controller allows the communication path for users and services to leverage for workloads and cluster management.

FixMe-Once setup, users can potentially interact with {pn_RKE1} through the web-based user interface (UI), the command-line interface ( CLI ), and programatically through the application programming interface ( API ). Depending upon the assigned roles, group membership and privileges, a user could:

* manage all clusters, users, roles, projects
* deploy new clusters, import other clusters, or remove existing ones
* manage workloads across respective or labeled clusters
* simply view clusters or workloads, or just benefit from what is running

ifdef::RC,RI[]
FixMe-For the best performance and security, the recommended deployment is a dedicated Kubernetes cluster for the Rancher management server. Running user workloads on this cluster is not advised. After deploying Rancher, you can create or import clusters for running workloads.
endif::RC,RI[]

ifdef::GS[]
FixMe-To aid in planning, training or assessing functionality like in a [<<G_PoC,proof-of-concept>>] deployment, {pn_RKE1} can be installed on a single node as described later in this document.

ifdef::BP[]
FixMe-TIP: The {pn_RKE1} backup operator can then be used to migrate from the single node to an installation on a high-availability Kubernetes cluster footnote:[https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.5/en/backups/migrating-rancher/]
endif::BP[]
endif::GS[]

FixMe-NOTE: Regardless of the deployment target, {pn_RKE1} should always run on a node or cluster that is separate from the downstream clusters that it manages. Running user workloads on this cluster is not advised.
