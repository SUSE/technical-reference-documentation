The base, starting configuration can reside all within a single server. Based upon the relatively small resource requirements for a SUSE Rancher deployment, a viable approach is to deploy as a virtual machine (VM) on the target nodes, on top of an existing hypervisor, like KVM. For physical host, there are tools that can be used during the setup of the server, see below. 

The Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller ( https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-ca/solutions/openmanage/idrac.htm[iDRAC] ) is designed for secure local and remote server management and helps IT administrators deploy, update and monitor Dell EMC PowerEdge servers anywhere, anytime.

The https://dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-ca/000124001/using-the-virtual-media-function-on-idrac-6-7-8-and-9[Virtual Media] function allows the remote usage of software image files (ISO-files), which can be used for installing operating systems or updating servers.
