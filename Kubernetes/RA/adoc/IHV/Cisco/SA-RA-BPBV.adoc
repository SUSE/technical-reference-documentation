Compute Platform::
Utilizing the above software application and technology solutions with the server platforms offered by {vn_Cisco_homePage}[{vn_Cisco}] {pn_CiscoUCS} ( {vn_CiscoUCS_homePage}[{an_CiscoUCS}] ) brings increased productivity, reduced total cost of ownership, and scalability into your computing realm. {an_Cisco} {an_CiscoUCS} is based upon industry-standard, x86-architecture servers with {an_Cisco} innovations and delivers a better balance of CPU, memory, and I/O resources. This balance brings processor power to life with more than 150 world-record-setting benchmark results that demonstrate leadership in application areas including virtualization, cloud computing, enterprise applications, database management systems, enterprise middleware, high-performance computing, and basic CPU integer and floating-point performance metrics.

* Match servers to workloads - The breadth of the server product line makes the process of matching servers to workloads straightforward, enabling you to achieve the best balance of CPU, memory, I/O, internal disk, and external storage-access resources using the blade, rack, multinode, or storage server form factor that best meets your organization’s data center requirements and preferred purchasing model.
* Powered by AMD EPYC processors or Intel Xeon Scalable processors
* Industry-leading bandwidth - {an_Cisco} {an_CiscoUCS} virtual interface cards have dramatically simplified the deployment of servers for specific applications. By making the number and type of I/O devices programmable on demand, enables organizations to deploy and repurpose server I/O configurations without ever touching the hardware.
* Lower infrastructure cost - Designed for lower infrastructure cost per server, is a choice that makes scaling fast, easy, and inexpensive in comparison to manually configured approaches.
* Rack server deployment flexibility - {an_Cisco} {an_CiscoUCS} {familyCiscoUCS-C} unique in the industry because they can be integrated with {an_Cisco} {an_CiscoUCS} connectivity and management or used as standalone servers
** Integrated Management Controller ( IMC ) - Running in the system’s Baseboard Management Controller (BMC), when a {an_Cisco} {an_CiscoUCS} {familyCiscoUCS-C} is integrated into a {an_Cisco} {an_CiscoUCS} domain, the fabric interconnects interface with the IMC to make the server part of a single unified management domain. When a server is used as a standalone server, direct access to the IMC through the servers’s management port allows a range of software tools (including {an_Cisco} Intersight) to configure the server through its API.
