While any developer or organization may simply start with a single, Kubernetes-based deployment, it is very common for that number of cluster instances to rapidly grow. While each of these may have specific focus areas, it becomes imperative to figure out how to use, manage, maintain and replicate all of these instances over time.

This is where {pn_Rancher} leads the industry, being able to manage access, usage, infrastructure and applications across clusters, that are Cloud Native Computing Foundation ( CNCF footnote:[https://www.cncf.io/] ) conformant and certified footnote:[https://www.cncf.io/certification/software-conformance], anywhere across edge, on-premise data centers, or cloud service providers. {pn_Rancher} optimizes creating and managing Kubernetes clusters like:

ifdef::iK3s[]
* Lightweight edge-centric {pn_K3s_ProductPage}[{pn_K3s}]
endif::iK3s[]
ifdef::iRKE1[]
* {pn_RKE1} ( {pn_RKE1_ProductPage}[{an_RKE1}] )
endif::iRKE1[]
// ifdef::iRKE2[]
// * {pn_RKE2} ( {pn_RKE2_ProductPage}[{an_RKE2}] )
// endif::iRKE2[]
* and other Kubernetes clusters that are based upon CNCF certified Kubernetes distributions or installations

and deployed across various {pn_Rancher_SupURL}[supported] infrastructure elements.
