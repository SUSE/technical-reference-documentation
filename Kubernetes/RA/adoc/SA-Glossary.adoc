* Factor(s)
ifdef::FCTR+Automation[]
+
[[G_Automation,Automation]]Automation footnote:Automation[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code[Infrastructure-as-Code]]::
Infrastructure automation enables speed through faster execution when configuring the infrastructure and aims at providing visibility to help other teams across the enterprise work quickly and more efficiently. Automation removes the risk associated with human error, like manual misconfiguration; removing this can decrease downtime and increase reliability. These outcomes and attributes help the enterprise move towards implementing a culture of DevOps, the combined working of development and operations.
endif::FCTR+Automation[]
ifdef::FCTR+Availability[]
+
[[G_Availability,Availability]]Availability footnote:Availability[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product[Availability]]::
The probability that an item operates satisfactorily, without failures or downtimes, under stated conditions as a function of its reliability, redundancy and maintainability attributes. Some major objectives to achieve a desired service level objectives are:
+
** Preventing or reducing the likelihood and frequency of failures via design decisions within the allowed cost of ownership
** Correcting or coping with possible component failures via resiliency, automated failover and disaster-recovery processes
** Estimating and analyzing current conditions to prevent unexpected failures via predictive maintenance
endif::FCTR+Availability[]
ifdef::FCTR+Integrity[]
+
[[G_Integrity,Integrity]]Integrity footnote:Integrity[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integrity[Data Integrity]]::
Integrity is the maintenance of, and the insurance of the accuracy and consistency of a specific element over its entire lifecycle. Both physical and logical aspects must be managed to ensure stability, performance, re-usability and maintainability.
endif::FCTR+Integrity[]
ifdef::FCTR+Performance[]
+
[[G_Performance,Performance]]Performance footnote:Performance[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_engineering[Performance Engineering]]::
In the context of a system's expected life cycle, performance is an assessment of transactions, responsiveness and underlying stability of the provider technology while doing tuning and adjustments. Other risk factors and discerning potential impacts to surrounding use cases are also integral parts of the profile to address beyond service levels, capacity and problem managmement.
endif::FCTR+Performance[]
ifdef::FCTR+Security[]
+
[[G_Security,Security]]Security footnote:Security[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security[Security]]::
Security is about ensuring freedom from or resilience against potential harm, including protection from destructive or hostile forces. To minimize risks, one mus manage governance to avoid tampering, maintain access controls to prevent unauthorized usage and integrate layers of defense, reporting and recovery tactics.

* Deployment Flavor(s)
+
ifdef::FLVR+PoC[]
[[G_PoC,proof-of-concept]]Proof-of-Concept footnote:Proof-of-Concept[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept[Proof of Concept]]::
A partial or nearly complete prototype constructed to demonstrate functionality and feasibility for verifying specific aspects or concepts under consideration.  This is often a starting point when evaluating a new, transitional technology. Sometimes it starts as a Minimum Viable Product ( MVP footnote:[link: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product[Minimum Viable Product]] ) that has just enough features to satisfy an initial set of requests. After such insights and feedback are obtained and potentially addressed, redeployments may be utilized to iteratively branch into other realms or to incorporate other known working functionality.
endif::FLVR+PoC[]
+
ifdef::FLVR+Production[]
[[G_Production,production]]Production::
A deployed environment that target customers or users can interact with and rely upon to meet their needs, plus be operationally sustainable in terms of resource utilization and economic constraints.
endif::FLVR+Production[]
+
ifdef::FLVR+Scaling[]
[[G_Scaling,scaling]]Scaling::
The flexibility of a system environment to either vertically scale-up, horizontally scale-out or conversely scale-down by adding or subtracting resources as needed. Attributes like capacity and performance are often the primary requirements to address, while still maintaining functional consistency and reliability.
