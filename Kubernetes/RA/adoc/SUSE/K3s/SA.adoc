{pn_K3s} is packaged as a single binary, which is about 50 megabytes in size. Bundled in that single binary is everything needed to run Kubernetes anywhere, including low-powered IoT and Edge-based devices. The binary includes:

* the container runtime
* any important host utilities like
** iptables, socat and du.

The only OS dependencies are the Linux kernel itself and a proper dev, proc and sysfs mounts (this is done automatically on all modern Linux distributions). {pn_K3s} bundles the Kubernetes components:

* kube-apiserver,
* kube-controller-manager,
* kube-scheduler,
* kubelet and
* kube-proxy

into combined processes that are presented as a simple server and agent model, as represented in the following figure:

{pn_K3s} can run as a complete cluster on a single node or can be expanded into a multi-node cluster. Besides the core Kubernetes components, these are also included:

* containerd,
* Flannel,
* CoreDNS,
* ingress controller and
* a simple host port-based service load balancer.

All of these components are optional and can be swapped out for your implementation of choice. With these included components, you get a fully functional and CNCF-conformant cluster so you can start running apps right away. {pn_K3s} is now a CNCF Sandbox project, being the first Kubernetes distribution ever to be adopted into sandbox.
