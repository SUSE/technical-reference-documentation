Telecommunications operators are transforming their networks to support 5G-Advanced, ORAN, massive MEC scale-out, and AI-driven automation. These transformations demand infrastructure that simultaneously delivers extreme packet-processing performance, deterministic low latency, integrated AI acceleration, and dramatically lower power and space footprints.

This reference configuration documents the successful validation of the {stelco-long} stack, featuring {rancher-long}, running on a Supermicro {smss} powered by Intel® Xeon® 6 SoC processors, proving that a single-socket, CPU-only platform can replace legacy accelerator-heavy designs.

== Market challenge

Telecommunications operators today face an *unprecedented convergence of pressures* that legacy
infrastructure was never designed to handle.
Traffic volumes are exploding, driven by nationwide 5G rollout, massive IoT deployments, ultra-high-definition video streaming, private 5G networks, and enterprise edge services.
At the same time, service-level agreements have become far more stringent with *sub-millisecond end-to-end latency and microsecond-level jitter* now mandatory for ORAN fronthaul/midhaul transport, Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communication (URLLC), industrial automation, and Extended Reality (XR) applications.

Compounding this is the *rapid integration of artificial intelligence* into every layer of the network.
Modern RAN and core functions increasingly rely on embedded machine-learning models for dynamic beamforming, traffic prediction, interference management, anomaly detection, and closed-loop automation through RIC platforms.
These AI-driven capabilities demand significant inferencing throughput directly at the edge, yet most existing deployments still depend on fixed-function RAN infrastructure defined before the AI boom.

*Power consumption, cooling capacity, and physical space* have emerged as hard limits at thousands of edge and far-edge sites.
Rising energy prices and sustainability mandates are pushing OPEX ever higher, while the continued reliance on specialized appliances, external accelerators, and vendor-locked platforms *dramatically inflates both CAPEX and lifecycle management overhead*.
Validation cycles lengthen, software updates become risky, and multi-vendor interoperability remains a constant friction point.

At the same time, regulators and enterprises are imposing *stricter requirements for data sovereignty*, hardware-rooted confidential computing, and verifiable platform integrity.
Operators must modernize at speed while simultaneously reducing cost, power, complexity, and risk - an equation that traditional architectures can no longer solve.



== Solution

The combination of {cpu} based telco-optimized systems by Supermicro and the {stelco} stack directly addresses every dimension of these challenges with a *single, fully integrated platform* that is *ready for massive scale-out* today.

At the foundation sits the {cpu}, a purpose-built processor family that delivers up to 72 Performance-cores, enormous per-core caches for deterministic packet processing, and fully integrated Intel vRAN Boost.
Native Intel AMX matrix extensions provide massive AI inferencing throughput without external accelerators, while on-die Intel QAT handles compression and cryptography at line rate.
With up to 128 PCIe Gen5 lanes and CXL 2.0 readiness, the platform offers unmatched I/O flexibility and future-proof expansion.

The 1U {smss112-website}[{smss112-long}] and 2U {smss212-website}[{smss212-long}] {smss} systems turn these silicon advantages into deployable reality.
Outdoor-rated and air-cooled compact designs with redundant Titanium power supplies fit perfectly into constrained edge sites.
The integrated E830 NIC delivers nanosecond-accurate Precision Time Protocol (PTP) and SyncE synchronization essential for vRAN and ORAN deployments.
The 1U system is already an {oran-doc}[{oran}].

SUSE completes the solution with {stelco}, the hardened, modular, cloud-native software stack specifically designed to meet the strict demands of the telecommunications industry by enabling operators to host both VNFs and CNFs on the same platform.
Built on {slm-website}[{slm}], {rke2-website}[{rke2}], and {rancher-website}[{rancher}], the platform provides a secure, carrier-grade foundation for 5G, fixed access, OSS/BSS, and edge infrastructure.
{stelco} is built entirely on open source and has been rigorously validated to deliver reliable performance at scale.
Its AI-ready, disaggregated architecture supports zero-touch automation and the flexibility to integrate best-of-breed network functions efficiently and sustainably.

{stelco} offers automated lifecycle management for infrastructure components, support for multi-cloud and edge deployments with consistent operations, and enhanced observability through integrated monitoring tools.
Furthermore, it ensures security at scale, from OS hardening to container scanning, while its foundation in open standards and ecosystem support effectively prevents vendor lock-in.
A key differentiator is SUSE’s robust edge computing capabilities, as {stelco} is optimized for constrained environments, enabling telcos to deploy CNFs and VNFs in remote or decentralized locations with minimal overhead - a flexibility essential for new 5G-powered services like smart city infrastructure and industrial IoT.
The solution also facilitates zero-touch provisioning and seamless orchestration at the edge, which dramatically reduces operational complexity and deployment times.
Ultimately, with its modular, open architecture, {stelco} allows operators to unlock efficiencies in the core, deploy innovative services at the edge, and adapt rapidly to future market demands.

By uniting Intel’s fully-integrated vRAN Boost and AI acceleration, Supermicro’s rugged edge-system engineering and global supply-chain excellence, and SUSE’s zero-touch, GitOps-driven telco cloud stack, this solution delivers a *true single-box, CPU-only telco cloud node* that simultaneously replaces the legacy BBU, external L1 accelerator (FPGA/in-line card), SmartNIC, timing card, and discrete AI inference appliances.
Under a 95% CPU load on the isolated cores, the platform *successfully achieves a measure of latency of sub 5 µs*.
This achievement demonstrates that this consolidated, CPU-only architecture in a single, outdoor-rated system can deliver the guaranteed, deterministic, low-latency performance required for the most demanding 5G and ORAN use cases that previously had to be spread across multiple devices.

With this, operators can realize {ref-vran-perf}[dramatic gains]:

* Up to 2.4x higher increase in RAN capacity vs previous generation per node

* Up to 70% lower power consumption, better performance per watt vs previous generation per site

* Up to 3.2x AI RAN inference performance per core[NP1]  gain vs previous generation


Moreover, the supply-chain risk is minimized through Supermicro’s Tier-1 scale and regional manufacturing, while {stelco} enables fully-automated, reproducible deployments across tens of thousands of sites with zero touch provisioning.
The entire platform is open, disaggregated, and future-proof, supporting everything from today’s RAN deployments to tomorrow’s AI-native 6G edge networks.

== Deployment prerequisites and requirements

Some specific considerations for {stelco} deployments are highlighted here.
For further details, see {stelco-docs-reqs}[{stelco} requirements and assumptions].


=== Hardware

* *Management Cluster*

** Must have network connectivity to the target server management/BMC API

** Must have network connectivity to the target server control plane network

** For multi-node Management Clusters, an additional reserved IP address is required
Hosts to be controlled


* *Managed hosts*

** Must support out-of-band management via Redfish, iDRAC or iLO interfaces

** Must support deployment via virtual media (PXE is not currently supported)

** Must have network connectivity to the Management Cluster for access to the Metal3 provisioning APIs


=== Software

Some tools are required, these can be installed either on the Management Cluster or on a host with access to the Management Cluster.
These include:

* {kubectl-website}[Kubectl]
* {helm-website}[Helm]
* {clusterctl-website}[Clusterctl]
* A container runtime, such as {podman-website}[Podman] or {rancherdesktop-website}[Rancher Desktop]

Additionally, the {slm-long} OS image must be downloaded from the {scc-website}[SUSE Customer Center] or {slm-downloads}[SUSE {slm} Downloads page].
The selected image file at the time of publication is `SL-Micro.x86_64-6.1-Base-GM.raw.xz`.


=== Network

Follow the official {stelco} guidelines and recommendations described in {stelco-docs-reqs}#id-network[{stelco} Network Requirements].


=== Ports

For details on port requirements, see {stelco-docs-reqs}#id-port-requirements[{stelco} Port Requirements].


=== Services (DHCP,DNS,etc)

For details on supported services such as DHCP, DNS, and others, see the {stelco-docs-reqs}#id-services-dhcp-dns-etc[{stelco} Services (DHCP, DNS, etc.)].


=== Disabling systemd services

For Telco workloads, it is important to disable or configure some services running on the nodes to avoid impacts on workload performance.

For information on disabling unnecessary systemd services, see the {stelco-docs-reqs}#id-disabling-systemd-services[{stelco} Disabling Systemd Services].


== Edge Image Builder

The need for easily auditable, reproducible, and customized base images becomes paramount to the long-term stability and maintainability of the environment.
{stelco-docs-eib}[Edge Image Builder (EIB)], one of the components of {stelco}, helps mitigate these concerns by providing a simple and quick mechanism to customize {slm} base images for a variety of scenarios.
EIB can produce an image that contains all of the configuration and workload artifacts (RPMs, container images, etc.) needed for telco deployments.
Thus, EIB can enable true zero-touch provisioning, even in low-bandwidth connections and air-gapped environments.
A single image can be reused across multiple nodes, including advanced situations such as deploying HA Kubernetes clusters and individualized network configurations per node.
By leveraging a declarative, YAML-based definition format, EIB easily fits into existing GitOps and CI/CD pipelines, generating reproducible images with full accountability of their contents.

EIB is an open source project.
Visit the official {eib-repo}[EIB repository] for more information.

==== Downstream Cluster deployment

To deploy the Downstream Cluster (provision the operating system and RKE2 cluster automatically), you need to create manifest files from the Management Cluster.
These files include the BareMetalHost definition file (`bmh.yaml`) and the provision file (`capi.yaml`).

* Create the BaremetalHost definition file (`bmh.yaml`) as shown below.

== Performance Testing

=== Intro

We are conducting performance tests to measure the CPU latency in scheduling new tasks on both isolated and housekeeping cores.
We utilize a Real-Time application, which is a simulator, to replicate specific workloads per CPU during defined time periods.
By configuring a JSON file, we can simulate a particular CPU load percentage and use cycletest to measure the latency associated with scheduling tasks concurrently.
Cycletest quantifies the latency before and after the task scheduling, subsequently generating a plot based on a resulting histogram.cat

=== CPU Performance

Based on the following configurations:

* Kernel args showed in the `capi.yaml` file
* Huge pages showed in the `capi.yaml` file
* CPU Isolation showed in the `capi.yaml` file
* Performance settings scripts showed in the `capi.yaml` and {stelco-docs-automated}[official documentation]
* CPU load 95% isolated cores

== Conclusions and Next Steps

The combination of SUSE Telco Cloud, Intel® Xeon® 6 SoC, and Supermicro telco-optimized servers delivers a future-proof, CPU-only telco-optimized cloud platform that delivers uncompromised performance, radical simplicity, genuine sustainability, and investment protection at scale while dramatically reducing power, physical space, and TCO. Together, we enable operators to stop compromising and start transforming.

To move forward with transforming your network, please contact your SUSE, Intel, and Supermicro account teams to arrange a joint solution workshop and receive expert sizing assistance tailored to your specific deployment needs.
For technical deep dives, you can access the {stelco-docs-atip}[SUSE Telco Cloud deployment documentation], review Intel’s resources on the {cpu-website}[{cpu} Networking and Edge], the {vRAN-platform}[Platform and Performance Advantages to Accelerate vRAN Deployments], and the {intel-pressrelease}[Leadership AI and Networking Solutions with Xeon 6 Processors], and examine the Supermicro specifications for the {smss112-website}[{smss112}] and {smss212-website}[{smss212}] systems.

This validated reference architecture confirms that SUSE Telco Cloud running on Supermicro telco-optimized systems powered by Intel Xeon 6 SoC processors can deliver a fully consolidated, CPU-only telco edge platform capable of supporting AI-native, low-latency 5G workloads at scale.
The solution was validated to meet stringent telco requirements, demonstrating deterministic sub-5 microsecond latency under high CPU utilization while consolidating vRAN acceleration, AI inference, networking, timing, and security into a single-socket system.

By replacing legacy accelerator-heavy designs with an integrated architecture, operators can significantly improve RAN capacity, power efficiency, and AI inference performance while reducing physical footprint, deployment complexity, and operational risk. SUSE Telco Cloud provides a hardened, cloud-native foundation with zero-touch provisioning, consistent lifecycle management, and support for both VNFs and CNFs across core, edge, and far-edge environments.

Together, Intel, Supermicro, and SUSE deliver a future-proof telco platform that enables operators to modernize their networks, scale AI-driven services, and prepare for next-generation 5G-Advanced and 6G use cases while lowering total cost of ownership and improving sustainability.
