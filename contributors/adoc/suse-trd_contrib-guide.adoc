// General comments
// Keep in mind that this is a "getting started" guide and the
//   audience that you are trying to reach.
// Leverage ASCIIDoc features to make this document readable and usable:
//   - Text highlights (follow SUSE style guides)
//   - Admonitions (i.e., NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, CAUTION, WARNING)
//   - Code blocks
//   - Lists (ordered and unordered, as appropriate)
//   - Links (to other resources)
//   - Images
//     - Place image files under the ./media directory tree
//       (e.g., ./media/src/svg, ./media/src/png)
//     - Format preference: svg > png > jpg
//     - Consolidate images wherever possible
//       (i.e., don't use two images when one conveys the message)
//   - Use sections and subsections to organize and group related
//     steps.

== Introduction

=== Motivation

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a motivation for the document in 2-4 sentences to identify:
//   - what the document is about
//   - why it may be of interest to the reader (e.g., a use case)
//   - what products are being highlighted
// Include an approved SUSE | Partner logo lock-up if possible
// Include any additional, relevant details
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

{product1_url1}[{product1_full}] ({product1})is an open collection of high quality guidance for solutions that address real-world use cases with featured SUSE, partner, and community components.
Documents are modular and rendered from multiple source files.
These source files are freely available and open source licensed in the {product1_url2}[GitHub repository].


{product1} can be generally divided into four types:

* *Getting Started Guide*
//
+
Solution introduction with step-by-step guidance for installation and configuration.

* *Reference Implementation*
//
+
Introductory architectural approach and basis for deployment of solution with the SUSE portfolio.

* *Reference Configuration*
//
+
Reference Implementation with specified partner hardware and software components.

* *Enterprise Architecture*
//
+
Architectural overview of solution from an enterprise landscape perspective.


Community engagement with {product1} is encouraged.
You can easily submit quick fixes and even section updates through _Report an issue_ links in the HTML version of any document.

If you have an interest in contributing a new document, you first should become familiar with the style, tools, and workflows of a successful contributor.



=== Scope

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Specify what this guide covers in no more than 2 sentences.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This guide outlines style, tools, and workflows for successful contributions to {product1}.


=== Audience

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify for whom this document is intended, perhaps with:
//   - topics of interests (e.g., machine learning, security, etc.)
//   - job roles (e.g., developer, administrator, platform architect, etc.)
//   - required skills
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This document is intended for architects, engineers, and technical writers who would like to contribute to {product1}.



== Prerequisites

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify any prerequisites the reader would need
// in order to follow the steps of this guide.
// - Link to existing resources whenever possible.
// - Keep this section brief but elaborate as needed.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =


Contributors to {product1} need the following:

* A plain text editor
+
[NOTE]
====
Your editor should save files encoded to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8[UTF-8] and end lines only with the line feed character.

See also {git-line-endings-url}[Configuring Git to handle line endings].
====

* {github-url}[GitHub] account and basic Git skills

* Basic understanding of the {asciidoc-url}[AsciiDoc] markup language
//
+
See <<AsciiDoc>>.

* DAPS toolchain (for rendering documents)
//
+
--
You have two options:

* {daps-install-url}[Install DAPS] and its dependencies directly, including the latest {suse-xsl-url}[SUSE XSL Stylesheets].

* Use the {daps2docker-url}[DAPS2Docker] container implementation.
--
+
See <<DAPS>> for more information.

* PDF viewer and Web browser (for reviewing rendered documents)

== Repository structure

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Describe the general file and directory structure
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

{product1} is both a {product1_url1}[website] with links to published documents and a {product1_url2}[GitHub repository] of their source files.
As a contributor, you need a general understanding of the structure of the source repository.


The repository's top-level directories are:

* _linux_: contains documentation focused primarily on aspects of Linux and related products, projects, and tools

* _kubernetes_: contains  documentation focused primarily on Kubernetes and related products, projects, and tools

* _common_: contains text (such as the license and disclaimer), images (such as official SUSE logos), templates (for various document types), and scripts (for simplifying and automating tasks) that may be used across the two major categories.

[listing]
----
├── common
│   ├── adoc
│   ├── bin
│   ├── images
│   └── templates
├── kubernetes
│   ├── enterprise
│   ├── reference
│   └── start
└── linux
    ├── enterprise
    ├── reference
    └── start
----


Inside the _linux_ and _kubernetes_ directories, are directories for the document types:

* _start_: getting started guides

* _reference_: reference implementations and reference configurations

* _enterprise_: enterprise architectures


=== Getting started guide structure

=== Reference Implementation and Reference Configuration structure

Coming soon.

== Templates and framework

// Outline use of setup scripts and templates
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Your {product1} documentation project relies on different types of source files, placed in specific locations within the repository's directory structure.
The files and structures can be created from scratch.
But you can use the provided automation tools to generate a framework for you, including templates for your source files.

=== Reference implementations and reference configurations
