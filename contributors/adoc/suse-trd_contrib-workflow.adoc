The {product1} {product1_url2}[GitHub repository] is an organized collection of source files for each document.
You can learn more about types of source files and how they are organized in <<Repository structure>>.

Contributors use a Git workflow with the following major steps:

. Fork the {product1} repository.

. Clone the fork.

. Make a branch.

. Create content.

. Submit a pull request.


Each of these steps is explored in more detail in the following sections.



=== Fork the {product1} repository

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Overview of how to create a fork of the upstream repository
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =


The first step is to create a fork of the {product1} repository into your own GitHub account.
This only needs to be done once.

[NOTE]
====
If you work for SUSE or a partner company, use your company-sanctioned GitHub account.
====

. Open your Web browser and log into your GitHub account.

. Navigate to the {product1} {product1_url2}[GitHub repository].

. Fork this repository into your own account.

.. In the GitHub UI, click __Fork__, then __+ Create a new fork__.
+

.. In the _Create a new fork_ dialog, you can keep the defaults.
+
image::suse-trd_github_fork_02.png[Fork the SUSE TRD GitHub repo, scaledwidth="85%"]

.. Click __Create fork__.

. If you are working with others on your document, you can invite them to collaborate in your repository fork.
+
image::suse-trd_github_collaborators-settings.png[Add GitHub collaborators, scaledwidth="65%"]
+
[NOTE]
====
Alternatively, others can fork your fork and follow a similar workflow and submit content and suggestions to you through pull requests.
====

.. Navigate to your fork.

.. Click __Settings__ > __Collaborators__ > __Add people__.

.. Enter the GitHub username, full name, or email address of your collaborator into the search field, then select the individual you wish to add.
+
[WARNING]
====
Be sure to verify that you select the correct individual.

SUSE employees should use approved GitHub accounts associated with their SUSE email addresses.
Partner contributors should use GitHub accounts associated with their employer email account.
====

.. Click __Add to this repository__.


=== Clone the fork

Create a clone of your fork so you can work on your local system.
When you clone a Git repository to your local system, you download a full copy of all the repository data at that point in time.
This includes not just source files but Git metadata too, including branches, commit history, and more.

. Launch a terminal on your local system.

. On the command line, change to the directory where you will store the clone, creating it if necessary.
//
+
For example,
+
[source, console]
----
mkdir -p ~/git/GITHUB_USER
cd ~/git/GITHUB_USER
----
where `GITHUB_USER` is your GitHub username.
+
[NOTE]
====
All forks of a Git repository share the same directory structure.
Creating the additional directory layer gives you the flexibility to host clones of other forks of the _upstream_ repository or even of the _upstream_ repository itself.
====

. Clone your fork.
+
[source, console]
----
git clone git@github.com:GITHUB_USER/technical-reference-documentation.git
----
+
[TIP]
====
Find the URL of your fork in the GitHub UI.

. Log into GitHub and go to your fork.

. Click __<> Code__.

. Select the __Local__ tab.

. Click __SSH__.

. Click the "copy" icon to copy the URL to your clipboard.
====

. Enter the top-level directory of your clone.
+
[source, console]
----
cd technical-reference-documentation
----

. Add the {product1} repository as your _upstream_ remote.
+
[source, console]
----
git remote add upstream git@github.com:SUSE/technical-reference-documentation.git
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Your clone's primary remote is named _origin_ and it represents the fork in your GitHub account.
====

. Verify your remotes.
+
[source, bash]
----
git remote -v
----
+
[listing]
----
origin  git@github.com:GITHUB_USER/technical-reference-documentation.git (fetch)
origin  git@github.com:GITHUB_USER/technical-reference-documentation.git (push)
upstream        git@github.com:SUSE/technical-reference-documentation.git (fetch)
upstream        git@github.com:SUSE/technical-reference-documentation.git (push)
----
+
[NOTE]
====
GITHUB_USER in this example would be replaced with your GitHub username.
====


=== Make a branch

Branches help you keep your work separate from that of others.
Think of a branch as an independent, project work area.
You create your document in a branch of your fork.
Later, you submit a pull request to merge this branch into the 'main' _upstream_ branch.

. Create a branch for your project.
//
+
For example,
+
[source, console]
----
git branch my-tuxy-project
----

. To work in this branch, you have to check it out.
+
[source, console]
----
git checkout my-tuxy-project
----

[TIP]
====
You can create and check out a branch at the same time with:

[source, console]
----
git checkout -b my-tuxy-project
----

====

[IMPORTANT]
====
It is a good practice to make sure your branch is active at the start of each editing session.
You can verify your current branch with:

[source, console]
----
git branch --show-current
----

====


=== Configure the framework

Your documentation project consists of multiple types of files, placed in specific locations within the directory structure of the {product1} repository.
Setting up this structure for your project can seem challenging.
Fortunately, there are automation tools to help you quickly generate a compliant framework with templates for the required source files.
See <<Templates and framework>> to learn more.


=== Create content

Good documentation often results from collaborative efforts and multiple editing sessions.
The following workflow can help you manage this process.

. Enter the local directory containing the clone of your GitHub fork.
For example:
+
[source, console]
----
cd ~/git/GITHUB_USER/technical-reference-documentation
----

. Check out your project's branch.
+
[source, console]
----
git checkout my-tuxy-project
----
+
[TIP]
====
Always remember to work in your branch.
====

. Update the clone from your _origin_ remote.
//
+
This allows you to integrate any edits or other content from your contributors, helping you minimize merge conflicts later.
+
[source, console]
----
git pull origin
----
+
[NOTE]
====
It is not necessary to specify the _origin_ remote, since it is configured as your default for tracking.
====
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Fix any merge errors before proceeding.
====

. Create your content.
//
+
A typical content session involves editing source files and copying assets (such as image files) into appropriate project directories.
Be sure to refer to <<Style>> and <<AsciiDoc>> to learn more about writing style and content formatting.

. Render your document with DAPS to verify content, layout, and style.
+
[NOTE]
====
You may get validation errors if you have invalid AsciiDoc syntax.
You must then find and correct these errors.
====

. Commit your changes locally.
//
+
For example:
+
[source, console]
----
git add .
git commit -m "updated section 5; added screenshot"
----
+
[TIP]
====
Always include a commit message as a reminder to yourself and to let your collaboration team know what changes you made in this commit.
====

. Push the commit to your _origin_ remote.
+
[source, console]
----
git push origin
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The first time you push a commit on your branch, you will see a warning like:

[listing]
----
fatal: The current branch my-tuxy-project has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin my-tuxy-project

To have this happen automatically for branches without a tracking
upstream, see 'push.autoSetupRemote' in 'git help config'.
----

Simply follow the instructions to fix the issue.

You only need to do this once.
====

. Repeat these steps until you are finished with new content.


[TIP]
====
It is a good idea to break up long content creation sessions.
Pause frequently to commit and push edits to your _origin_ remote.
====


=== Submit a pull request

Before you submit your document, be sure to update your fork with changes in the 'main' branch of the {product1} GitHub repository.

. Open a local terminal and change to your clone directory.
//
+
For example:
+
[source, console]
----
cd ~/git/GITHUB_USER/technical-reference-documentation
----

. Check out your 'main' branch.
+
[source, console]
----
git checkout main
----

. Update your clone with changes in the _upstream_ remote.
+
[source, console]
----
git pull upstream main
----

. Synchronize these updates to your _origin_ remote.
+
[source, console]
----
git push origin
----


With your document in good shape and your fork synchronized, it is time to submit your document for official review.
To do this, you submit a pull request (PR) from the GitHub UI.

. Log into your GitHub account.

. Select your fork of the _upstream_ repository.

. Select your branch and click __Compare & pull request__.
+
image::suse-trd_github_pr_01.png[GitHub PR Creation - select branch, scaledwidth="85%"]

. Verify that your branch is able to be merged and click __Create pull request__.
//
+
You can add any helpful notes to the reviewer in the provided space.
+
image::suse-trd_github_pr_02.png[GitHub PR Creation - compare changes, scaledwidth="85%"]

. Follow the status of your pull request in the GitHub __Pull requests__ page of the upstream repository.
//
+
Respond to comments and suggestions in the __Conversation__ tab.
+
image::suse-trd_github_pr_03.png[GitHub PR Creation - review, scaledwidth="85%"]

. When your document is ready, verify that is published to the {product1} {product1_url1}[website].

. After your document has been published, clean up your work area.

.. Delete your previous branch.
+
[source, console]
----
git checkout main
git branch -d my-tuxy-project
----

.. Merge upstream changes to your local fork.
+
[source, console]
----
git pull upstream main
----

.. Synchronize your fork.
+
[source, console]
----
git push origin
----
