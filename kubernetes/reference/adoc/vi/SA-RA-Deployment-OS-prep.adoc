The underlying Linux operating system can be:

* A cloud-host virtual machine (VM) or a bare-metal node
* An on-premise VM or a bare-metal server node

Preparation(s)::
To meet the solution stack prerequisites and requirements, {companyName} operating system offerings, like
ifdef::layerSLEMicro[link:{pn_SLEMicro_ProductPage}[{pn_SLEMicro}]]
ifdef::layerSLES[link:{pn_SLES_ProductPage}[{pn_SLES}]]
can be utilized.

. Ensure these services are in place and configured for this node to use:
+
** Domain Name Service (DNS) - an external network-accessible service to map IP Addresses to hostnames
** Network Time Protocol (NTP) - an external network-accessible service to obtain and synchronize system times to aid in time stamp consistency
** Software Update Service - access to a network-based repository for software update packages. This can be accessed directly from each node via registration to
*** the general, internet-based link:{suseSCCPage}[{companyName} Customer Center] (SCC) or
*** an organization's link:{pn_SUMa_ProductPage}[{pn_SUMa}] infrastructure or
*** a local server running an instance of link:{pn_RMT_DocURL}[{pn_RMT}] ({an_RMT})

NOTE: During the node's installation, it can be pointed to the respective update service. This can also be accomplished post-installation with the command-line tool named link:{kb_SUSEConnect}[SUSEConnect].
