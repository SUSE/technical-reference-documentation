Preparation(s)::
For each node used in the deployment:

* Validate the necessary CPU, memory, disk capacity, and network interconnect quantity and type are present for each node and its intended role. Refer to the recommended CPU/Memory/Disk/Networking requirements as noted in the
ifdef::focusRancher[link:{pn_Rancher_HWReqURL}[{pn_Rancher} Hardware Requirements].]
ifdef::focusK3s[link:{pn_K3s_HWReqURL}[{pn_K3s} Hardware Requirements].]
ifdef::focusRKE1[link:{pn_RKE1_HWReqURL}[{pn_RKE1} Hardware Requirements].]
ifdef::focusRKE2[link:{pn_RKE2_HWReqURL}[{pn_RKE2} Hardware Requirements].]
* Further suggestions
** Disk : Use a pair of local, direct attached, mirrored disk drives is present on each node (SSDs are preferred); these will become the target for the operating system installation.
** Network : Prepare an IP addressing scheme and optionally create both a public and private network, along with the respective subnets and desired VLAN designations for the target environment.
*** Baseboard Management Controller : If present, consider using a distinct management network for controlled access.
** Boot Settings : BIOS/uEFI reset to defaults for a known baseline, consistent state or perhaps with desired, localized values.
** Firmware : Use consistent and up-to-date versions for BIOS/uEFI/device firmware to reduce potential troubleshooting issues later
