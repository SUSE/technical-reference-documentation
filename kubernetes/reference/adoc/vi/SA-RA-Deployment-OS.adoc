Deployment Process::
On the compute platform node, install the noted {companyName} operating system, by following these steps:

. Download the
ifdef::layerSLEMicro[link:{pn_SLEMicro_Download}[{pn_SLEMicro}]]
ifdef::layerSLES[link:{pn_SLES_Download}[{pn_SLES}]]
product (either for the ISO or Virtual Machine image)
** Identify the appropriate, supported version of
ifdef::layerSLEMicro[{pn_SLEMicro}]
ifdef::layerSLES[{pn_SLES}]
by reviewing the support matrix for link:{pn_Rancher_SupportMatrixURL}[{pn_Rancher}] versions Web page.
+
. The installation process is described and can be performed with default values by following steps from the product documentation, see
ifdef::layerSLEMicro[link:{pn_SLEMicro_InstallationDocURL}[Installation Quick Start]]
ifdef::layerSLES[link:{pn_SLES_InstallationDocURL}[Installation Quick Start]]
+
TIP: Adjust both the password and the local network addressing setup to comply with local environment guidelines and requirements.

ifdef::layerK3s,focusK3s[]
// ifdef::layerSLEMicro+focusK3s[]
// . On the target node with a default installation of
// {pn_SLEMicro}
// operating system, log in to the node either as root or as a user with sudo privileges and install a required package for the next layer.

// sudo transactional-update pkg install apparmor-parser

Deployment Consideration(s)::
To further optimize deployment factors, leverage the following practices:

ifdef::FCTR+Automation[]
* <<g-automation>>
** To reduce user intervention, unattended deployments of
ifdef::layerSLEMicro[{pn_SLEMicro}]
ifdef::layerSLES[{pn_SLES}]
can be automated
*** for ISO-based installations, by referring to the
ifdef::layerSLES[link:{pn_SLES_AutoYaSTDocURL}[AutoYaST Guide]]
ifdef::layerSLEMicro[link:{pn_SLEMicro_AutoYaSTDocURL}[AutoYaST Guide]]
ifdef::layerSLEMicro[]
*** for raw-image based installation, by configuring the Ignition and Combustion tooling as described in the link:{pn_SLEMicro_InstallationDocURL}[Installation Quick Start]
endif::layerSLEMicro[]
endif::FCTR+Automation[]

////
TIP: An additional consideration is, for the first node deployed, to create an additional IP address on the host network interface card. This can be used for the {pn_Rancher} access, which may also become managed by a load-balancer if a multi-node cluster becomes the base.
