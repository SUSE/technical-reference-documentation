Target : How to use this platform for this solution deployment

Given the partner/family/model, cite specific steps to

- interact with the device
- prep to setup (like firmware, BIOS setting, device inclusion/assumptions)
- licensing/...
- etc.

so that the system is ready to deploy the next layer (i.e. OS) effectively

The base, starting configuration can reside all within a single {vn_HPQ} {modelHPQ-ZCentral4R}. Based upon the relatively small resource requirements for a
ifdef::focusRancher[{pn_Rancher}]
ifdef::focusK3s[{pn_K3s}]
ifdef::focusRKE1[{pn_RKE1}]
ifdef::focusRKE2[{pn_RKE2}]
deployment, a viable approach is to deploy as a virtual machine (VM) on the target nodes, on top of an existing hypervisor, like Kernel-bsed Virtual Machine (KVM). 
Another option is to use one or more {vn_HPQ} {modelHPQ-ZCentral4R} baremetal systems for the deployments. For the physical host, there are tools that can be used 
during the setup of the server, as detailed below.

Preparation(s)::
When the system is obtained, connect the network cables and a display monitor, keyboard and mouse to interact with the {vn_HPQ} {modelHPQ-ZCentral4R}.

Deployment Process::
On the respective compute module node

. Given the simplicity of the deployment, the operating system can 
** be installed with the respective {companyName} operating system media ISO media,
** be converted to a USB drive, or
** leverage Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) infrastructure.
. For deployments targeting virtual machines, determine if a hypervisor is already available or provisioned.
** If this will be the first use of this node, an option is to deploy a KVM hypervisor, based upon {pn_SLES} by following the link:{pn_SLES_VirtDocURL}[Virtualization Guide].
** Then for the solution VM node, use the hypervisor user interface to allocate the necessary CPU, memory, disk and networking as noted in the {pn_Rancher} link:{pn_Rancher_HWReqURL}[hardware requirements].

Deployment Consideration(s)::
To further optimize system resources, leverage the following practice(s):
ifdef::FCTR+Performance[]
* <<g-performance>>
** If a Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) is present in the {vn_HPQ} {modelHPQ-ZCentral4R}, include deployment of the respective device driver at the operating system level and potentially 
obtain any available respective container runtime libraries for cloud-native workloads to access this resource.
