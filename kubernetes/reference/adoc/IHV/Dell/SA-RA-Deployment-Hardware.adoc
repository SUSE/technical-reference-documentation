The base, starting configuration can reside all within a single server. Based upon the relatively small resource requirements for a

deployment, a viable approach is to deploy as a virtual machine (VM) on the target nodes, on top of an existing hypervisor, like KVM. For physical host, there are tools that can be used during the setup of the server, see below.

The Integrated {an_Dell} Remote Access Controller (link:https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-ca/solutions/openmanage/idrac.htm[iDRAC]) is designed for secure local and remote server management and helps IT administrators deploy, update and monitor {an_Dell} {familyDell-PE} servers anywhere, anytime.
