Target : How to use this platform for this solution deployment

Given the partner/family/model, cite specific steps to

- interact with the device
- prep to setup (like firmware, BIOS setting, device inclusion/assumptions)
- licensing/...
- etc.

so that the system is ready to deploy the next layer (i.e. OS) effectively

The base starting configuration can reside all within a single {an_Ampere} {modelAmpere-Altra} platform. Based upon the relatively small resource requirements for a
ifdef::focusRancher[{pn_Rancher}]
ifdef::focusK3s[{pn_K3s}]
ifdef::focusRKE1[{pn_RKE1}]
ifdef::focusRKE2[{pn_RKE2}]
deployment, one viable approach is to deploy as a virtual machine (VM) on the target nodes, on top of an existing hypervisor, like kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM). Another option is to use one or more {an_Ampere} {modelAmpere-Altra} or {an_Ampere} {modelAmpere-AltraMax} baremetal systems for the deployments. For the physical host, there are tools that can be used during the setup of the server (see below).

Preparation(s)::
If available, the integrated Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) provides remote access to multiple users at different locations for networking. It also allows a system administrator to monitor system health and manage computer events remotely, including media, either virtual or physical) redirection of software image files used for installing operating systems and a console interaction.

Deployment Process::
On the respective compute module node

. Given the simplicity of the deployment, the operating system can be
** installed with the respective {companyName} operating system media ISO media,
** converted to a USB drive, or
** installed leveraging Preboot Execution Environment (PXE) infrastructure.
. For deployments targeting virtual machines, determine if a hypervisor is already available or provisioned.
** If this will be the first use of this node, an option is to deploy a KVM hypervisor, based upon {pn_SLES} by following the link:{pn_SLES_VirtDocURL}[Virtualization Guide].
** Then, for the solution VM node, use the hypervisor user interface to allocate 
the necessary CPU, memory, disk and networking as noted in the {pn_Rancher} link:{pn_Rancher_HWReqURL}[hardware requirements].

Deployment Consideration(s)::
To further optimize deployment factors, leverage the following practices:

* <<g-scaling>>
** While the initial deployment only requires a single VM, as noted in later deployment sections, having multiple VMs provides resiliency to accomplish high availability. To reduce single points of failure, it is beneficial to have the multi-VM deployments spread across multiple hypervisor nodes. 
** The consideration of consistent hypervisor and compute module configurations, with the needed resources for the deployed VMs, will yield a robust and reliable production implementation.
