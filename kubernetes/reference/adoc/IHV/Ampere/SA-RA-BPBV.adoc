Compute Platform::
The above software application and technology solutions are used with the platforms utilizing link:{vn_Ampere_homePage}[{vn_Ampere}] that provides the industry’s first cloud native processors. As the term implies, these compute platforms are built to host many containers that must adhere to strict service level agreement (SLA) requirements, uniquely delivering the performance, scalability, security and power efficiency that is focused on today’s hyperscale cloud and edge computing workloads and applications. Providing the highest total performance and performance per watt of power, these {an_Ampere} Arm-based processors deliver a sustainable server solution for data center applications and enabling cloud service providers to meet the compute demands of the future with only a fraction of the power and real estate consumed today. 

* High Performance
** {an_Ampere} processor products are single-threaded, run at consistently high frequencies, and are built with large low-latency private caches. This results in predictable high performance that elastically scales in a linear fashion for all the cloud native applications built in containers and managed by Kubernetes. The architecture also lends itself to high utilization and delivers consistent performance under maximum load conditions.
* Linear Scalability
** {an_Ampere} cloud native processors add more and often get more of the same performance you got last time. In addition to being the leader in power efficiency, {an_Ampere}’s high performance cloud native processors contain up to 128 cores, by far the most in the industry. These cloud native processors were architected and designed from the ground up to deliver on the metrics that matter for modern cloud native applications including a level of rack scalability that allows a rack density of over 3000 cores yielding the best container density in the industry for micro-service based services orchestrated by cloud native tools like Kubernetes.
* Predictability
** {an_Ampere} aligns both the hardware and software to provide constant and consistent performance even under heavy load conditions.
* Sustainability
** Cloud Service Providers’ relentless drive to achieve carbon neutrality requires power efficient servers. {an_Ampere}'s extremely power efficient cores that deliver exceptional performance. Legacy processors fall short of meeting modern cloud compute requirements. In fact data centers built with {an_Ampere} {modelAmpere-AltraMax} processors at scale can be up to 60% more efficient from a power consumption perspective for equivalent application performance needs.
