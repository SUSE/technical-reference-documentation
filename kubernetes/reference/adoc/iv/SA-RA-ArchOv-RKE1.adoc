The figure below illustrates the high-level architecture overview of Kubernetes components on instances like {pn_RKE1}:

A Kubernetes cluster consists of a set of nodes machines, called workers or agents, that host and run containerized applications in Pods. Every cluster has at least one worker node. The control plane manages the worker nodes and the Pods in the cluster. The provider API is a generic element that allows external interaction with the Kubernetes cluster.

Control Plane Components::
The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), and detecting and responding to cluster events.
* kube-apiserver
** The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API
* etcd
** Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.
* kube-scheduler
** Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.
* kube-controller-manager
** Control plane component that runs controller processes.

Node Components::
Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.
* kubelet
** An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod.
* kube-proxy
** A network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept.

NOTE: Regardless of the deployment instance, {pn_RKE1} could always be deployed directly by {pn_Rancher} or imported as a managed, downstream cluster.
