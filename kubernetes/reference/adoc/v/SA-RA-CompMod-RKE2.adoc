ifdef::focusRKE2[]
This section describes the various components being used to create a {pn_RKE2} solution deployment, in the perspective of top to bottom ordering. When completed, the {pn_RKE2} instance can be used as the application infrastructure for cloud-native workloads and can be imported into {pn_Rancher} for management.

=== Software - {pn_RKE2}

include::../SUSE/RKE2/SA.adoc[]

ifdef::RC,RI[]
While all {pn_RKE2} roles can be installed on a single system, a multi-node cluster, is a more production-like approach and will be described in the deployment section.

ifdef::BP[]
TIP: To improve availability, performance and security, the recommended deployment of a {pn_RKE2} cluster is a pair of nodes for the control plane role, at least three etcd role-based nodes and three or more worker nodes.
endif::BP[]
endif::RC,RI[]

ifdef::GS[]
As {pn_RKE2} can be deployed on a single node, only some prerequisites for the underlying operating system are needed and will be detailed in the deployment section.

Depending on the number and complexity of the components this proceeding section might better be represented as a table with brief descriptions.   Fewer components can be expressed in short paragraph form.

=== Compute Platform

Leveraging the enterprise grade functionality of the operating system mentioned in the previous section, many compute platforms can be the foundation of the deployment:

* Virtual machines on supported hypervisors or hosted on cloud service providers
* Physical, baremetal or single-board computers, either on-premises or hosted by cloud service providers
