== Component model

This section describes the various components being used to create a {pn_Rancher} solution deployment, in the perspective of top to bottom ordering. Once completed, the {pn_Rancher} instance enables the management of multiple, downstream Kubernetes clusters.

=== Component overview

By using:

ifdef::RC,RI,GS[]
* Software
** Multi-cluster Management Server - {pn_Rancher}
ifdef::GS[]
** Linux Operating System
endif::GS[]
ifndef::GS[]
** Kubernetes Platform -
ifdef::layerK3s[{pn_K3s}]
ifdef::layerRKE1[{pn_RKE1}]
ifdef::layerRKE2[{pn_RKE2}]
** Linux Operating System -
ifdef::layerSLEMicro[{pn_SLEMicro}]
ifdef::layerSLES[{pn_SLES}]
* Compute Platform
endif::GS[]

you can create the necessary infrastructure and services. Further details for these components are described in the following sections.

ifdef::SWComp[]

=== Software - {pn_Rancher}

include::../SUSE/Rancher/SA.adoc[]

ifdef::GS[]
As {pn_Rancher} can be deployed on a single node, some simple prerequisites for the underlying operating system are needed and will be described in the <<Deployment>> section.
endif::GS[]
ifdef::RC,RI[]
For a production implementation of {pn_Rancher}, deploying upon a Kubernetes platform is required and the next sections describe the suggested component layering approach.

Depending on the number and complexity of the components this proceeding section might better be represented as a table with brief descriptions.   Fewer components can be expressed in short paragraph form.

=== Compute Platform

Leveraging the enterprise grade functionality of the operating system mentioned in the previous section, many compute platforms can be the foundation of the deployment:

* Virtual machines on supported hypervisors or hosted on cloud service providers
* Physical, baremetal or single-board computers, either on-premise or hosted by cloud service providers
