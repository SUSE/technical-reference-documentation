== Component model

ifdef::focusK3s[]
This section describes the various components being used to create a {pn_K3s} solution deployment, in the perspective of top to bottom ordering. Once completed, the {pn_K3s} instance can be used as the application infrastructure for cloud-native workloads and can be imported into {pn_Rancher} for management.

=== Component overview

By using:

ifdef::RC,RI,GS[]
* Software
** Kubernetes Platform - {pn_K3s}
ifdef::GS[]
** Linux Operating System
endif::GS[]
ifndef::GS[]
** Linux Operating System -
ifdef::layerSLEMicro[{pn_SLEMicro}]
ifdef::layerSLES[{pn_SLES}]
* Compute Platform
endif::GS[]

you can create the necessary infrastructure and services. Further details for these components are described in the following sections.

ifdef::SWComp[]

=== Software - {pn_K3s}

include::../SUSE/K3s/SA.adoc[]

ifdef::GS[]
As {pn_K3s} can be deployed on a single node, only some prerequisites for the underlying operating system are needed and will be detailed in the <<Deployment>> section.
endif::GS[]
ifdef::RC,RI[]
As {pn_K3s} can be deployed on a single or multiple nodes, the next sections describe the suggested component layering approach.
endif::RC,RI[]

ifndef::GS[]

ifdef::layerSLEMicro[]
=== Software - {pn_SLEMicro}

include::../SUSE/SLE-Micro/SA.adoc[]

endif::layerSLEMicro[]

ifdef::layerSLES[]
=== Software - {pn_SLES}

include::../SUSE/SLES/SA.adoc[]

endif::layerSLES[]

Depending on the number and complexity of the components this proceeding section might better be represented as a table with brief descriptions.   Fewer components can be expressed in short paragraph form.

=== Compute Platform

Leveraging the enterprise grade functionality of the operating system mentioned in the previous section, many compute platforms can be the foundation of the deployment:

* Virtual machines on supported hypervisors or hosted on cloud service providers
* Physical, baremetal or single-board computers, either on-premise or hosted by cloud service providers

Provide a description of the Systems used and their position in the solution.  Each system should explain why the characteristics of that system is a good fit for the SW Component or architecture.
