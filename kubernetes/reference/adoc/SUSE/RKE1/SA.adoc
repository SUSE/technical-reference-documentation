{pn_RKE1} is a CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution that runs entirely within Docker containers. It solves the common frustration of installation complexity with Kubernetes by removing most host dependencies and presenting a stable path for deployment, upgrades, and rollbacks.

With {pn_RKE1} [{an_RKE1}], the operation of Kubernetes is easily automated and entirely independent of the operating system and platform you’re running. As long as you can run a supported version of Docker, you can deploy and run Kubernetes with {an_RKE1}. It builds a cluster from a single command in just a few minutes, and its declarative configuration makes Kubernetes upgrades atomic and safe.

What is provided with {pn_RKE1}::
* CNCF Certification
** {pn_RKE1} CNCF certification means that every release supports the same APIs as upstream Kubernetes. This gives enterprises the confidence that their Kubernetes resources are portable between {an_RKE1} and other CNCF-certified Kubernetes distributions.
* Simplified installation
** Installation is via a single binary and it uses a single YAML file, meaning that even non-experts can deploy Kubernetes with a single command. The command connects to remote hosts via SSH, so Rancher or any staff member with SSH access can deploy and manage {an_RKE1} instances anywhere in the world.
* Automated Operation
** When used with {pn_Rancher}, operators can perform automated installation and upgrades of {an_RKE1} clusters with just a few clicks.
* Vendor Independence
** {an_RKE1} is not locked into a specific vendor operating system, Kubernetes Management Platform or proprietary tooling.
* Safe, Atomic Upgrades
** Since {an_RKE1} is built using containers, it doesn’t have any touch points with the underlying operating system beyond the container engine. Containers make it easy to upgrade to a new version and to roll back to the previous version if necessary. 
* 24x7 Enterprise-level Support
** Ensures around-the-clock support from technical experts when you need it.

The fundamental roles for the nodes and core functionality of {pn_RKE1} are represented in the following figure:

* Kubernetes API Server,
** interacts with kubelet on all the nodes, plus addresses authentication, user interface (UI), command-line interface (CLI) and API for external access and cluster management via {pn_Rancher} cluster controller to agent

ifdef::RC,RI[]
While all {pn_RKE1} roles can be installed on a single system, for the best availability, performance and security, the recommended deployment of a {pn_RKE1} cluster is a pair of nodes for the control plane role, at least three etcd role-based nodes and three or more worker nodes.

ifdef::GS[]
To aid in planning, training or assessing functionality like in a [<<g-poc,proof-of-concept>>] deployment, {pn_RKE1} can be installed on a single node as described later in this document.
endif::GS[]

{pn_RKE1} can run as a complete cluster on a single node or can be expanded into a multi-node cluster. Besides the core Kubernetes components, these are also configurable and included:

* Multiple Kubernetes versions
* CoreDNS, Metrics, Ingress controller
* CNI : Canal, Calico, Flannel, Weave
* Support for a Windows worker agent node (only with Flannel)
* Fleet Agent : for GitOps deployment of cloud-native applications

All of these components are configurable and can be swapped out for your implementation of choice. With these included components, you get a fully functional and CNCF-conformant cluster so you can start running apps right away.
