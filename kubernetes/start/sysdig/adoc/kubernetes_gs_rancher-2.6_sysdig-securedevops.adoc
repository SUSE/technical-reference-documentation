=== Scope

This guide will help you take the first steps to integrate SUSE Rancher with Sysdig Secure DevOps Platform.


=== Audience

This document is intended for DevOps and DevSecOps engineers, security professionals, and developers who are responsible for enabling security across containers, clusters, and clouds.


== Technical overview

The capabilities of Sysdig Secure and Sysdig Monitoring for SUSE Rancher are enabled by deploying the Sysdig agent on the nodes of your cluster.
Relevant data and metadata are collected and available in the Sysdig SaaS back-end and accessible via the Sysdig user interface (UI).
The Sysdig UI also provides the ability to customize aspects like policies, alerts, visualizations, permissions, etc.

Minimum requirements:

* A Sysdig cloud account.
You can get started with a free trial by visiting https://sysdig.com/start-free/[https://sysdig.com/start-free].

* A SUSE Rancher cluster with a RKE, K3s, or any CNCF-certified Kubernetes cluster.
Clusters can be located on-premises or in the cloud.
You can also begin with community Rancher.

* Outbound Internet access (at least port 6443).
This allows collected information to be sent to the Sysdig back-end.

You can find the prerequisites for the Sysdig agent install on Kubernetes in https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/installation/sysdig-agent/agent-installation/agent-install-kubernetes/#agent-install-kubernetes[the Sysdig documentation].


== Installation

Get started by installing the Sysdig agent in your cluster.
You can do so by using the SUSE Rancher Apps & Marketplace or by installing manually.

=== Install from the SUSE Rancher Apps & Marketplace

. From the top-left Rancher menu select __Apps & Marketplace__.
From here, you will be taken to the __Charts__ page.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_marketplace-overview.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Locate and select __Sysdig Monitor & Secure__, which will automate installation of the Sysdig agent via the https://github.com/sysdiglabs/charts-rancher[Sysdig Helm chart].

. Specify a namespace, such as `sysdig`.

. Provide the https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/administration/administration-settings/agent-installation-overview-and-key/#agent-installation-overview-and-key[Sysdig access key].
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_install-2.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Click Install.
Once you initiate the Helm chart, within 15 minutes you should begin seeing data and activity in your Sysdig UI.


=== Install using generic/manual steps

To install the Sysdig agent using manual steps, follow the instructions in https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/installation/sysdig-agent/agent-installation/agent-install-kubernetes/steps-for-rancher/#steps-for-rancher[the Sysdig documentation].


== Use case and demonstration

Sysdig Secure runtime security provides policy-driven detections, based on the https://falco.org[Falco] open-source project.
Using predefined and custom policies, you can automate detection and alerting of suspicious and unexpected activity across containers, clusters, clouds.

In this example, you will create a custom runtime security policy that will detect when a shell is spawned in a container with a terminal attached.
This can be practically useful, as commands executed with a terminal inside a container can be an indicator of an infiltration or attack.

[NOTE]
====
For this example we are creating a *simple* custom rule that can be inhibited by other rules.
We strongly recommend disallowing the predefined rule __Suspicious Container Activity__ before adding the new rule (via __Policies__ > __Runtime Policies__ > __Suspicious Container Activity__).

After the experiment, reactivate the __Suspicious Container Activity__ rule again.
====


=== Define and enable the customer runtime security policy

. Create the policy.

.. Log into Sysdig Secure and, in the left panel, select __Policies__ > __Runtime Policies__.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_select-runtime.png[scaledwidth="50%", align="center"]
+
This opens the __Runtime Policies__ page, where you can see the predefined policies.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_Runtime-Policies.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

.. To create a custom policy, first select __Add Policy__ in the upper right corner.
Then, in the pop-up screen, select __Workload Policy__.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_choose-policy.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

.. In the __New Policy__ screen, enter a name and a description.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_new-policy-name.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]
... Keep the policy defaults: __Enabled__ and a __Severity__ level of __High__.
... You can customize the scope of this rule, indicating where it should apply.
In this example, the scope is contained to a namespace, called `terminal-shell-in-container`.
You can also set this to a broader scope, such as `kubernetes.cluster.name`, for example.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_policy-scope.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]


. Assign a rule to use with the policy.

.. Select __Import from Library__.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_import.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

.. Find and select __Terminal shell in a container__ from the __Rules Library__, then click __Import Rules__.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_rules-library.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

.. You should now see the __Terminal shell in a container__ rule assigned to your policy.


. Specify the desired actions when a policy is triggered under __Actions__ in the UI.

.. Choose to kill, stop, or pause the container.
+
For this example, leave this set to Nothing.
+
For more information about Actions, see the https://docs.sysdig.com/en/docs/sysdig-secure/policies/manage-policies/#define-actions[Sysdig documentation].

.. Set your desired notification channel.
+
The default notification channel is email, but you can configure additional options under __Settings__ > __Notification Channels__.
For example, notifications can also be sent to a Slack Channel.
Alternatively, leave this field blank.


. Enable recording of system call data surrounding an event.

.. Turn on __Capture__.

.. Provide a file name.

.. Choose the number of seconds before and after the event to record.
+
For example, 10 seconds before, and 20 seconds after the event.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_capture-config.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Create the policy by clicking __Save__.


=== Trigger a test event

You can trigger a test event to observe how Sysdig Secure detects the terminal shell in a container event and drill into the captured information to help you investigate the incident.

. Open a terminal shell from any container that is running in your SUSE Rancher cluster.
.. Go to the __Workloads__ section and access any pod with a running container.
+
For this example, you can use the Sysdig agent pod.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_open-terminal-shell-from-rancher-ui-1.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

.. From the menu on the right, click the __Execute Shell__ option, and a new terminal shell will be shown at the bottom of the screen.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_open-terminal-shell-from-rancher-ui-2.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

This is sufficient for Sysdig to capture the event.
You can type a few commands in the terminal to generate additional data that also will be captured by Sysdig Secure.


=== Viewing and investigating the event

Once the runtime security policy created above is triggered, you can view more information about the event in the Sysdig UI.

. Click __Events__.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_events.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

. Click the "Terminal shell in a container" entry to open and view additional information about the event.
+
You can scroll through this panel to see information, such as:

* Information about the policy and rule(s) triggered.
* Details about where the activity took place in your cluster (Scope), including which container as well as the detected process (in this case, `bash`).
* “Tags” that indicate violated compliance standards, etc.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_event-details.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

. Dig deeper by clicking __Respond__ at the top of this panel and selecting __View Activity Audit__.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_view-audit.png[scaledwidth="65%", align="center"]
+
In the __Activity Audit__ screen you will find details about the incident, including commands issued, file activity, network activity, and `kube-exec` activity.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_activity-audit.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

. Click any line item to see additional details, such as user, host, and scope.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_Kubernetes-details.png[scaledwidth="50%", align="center"]

. Click __Captures__ from the top of the __Activity Audit__ page to explore the capture file created when the incident triggered.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_view-capture-1.png[scaledwidth="50%", align="center"]

. Click the shovel icon to the right of the "Terminal shell in a container" capture file to open it with Sysdig Inspect.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_view-capture-2.png[scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. In the new tab, you are presented with a set of tiles that categorize the available details within the capture file.
You can select any of these tiles to identify where the activity is within the timeline and drag the bars at the bottom to narrow into a specific area within the file.
+
image::kubernetes_gs_rancher-2.6_sysdig-securedevops_image_Inspect.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

. Click one of the tiles, such as __Executed Interactive Commands__, to view further information about that particular activity and continue to drill down to investigate the incident.
