== Technical overview

// Architecture diagram

// Description
Ondat uses storage attached to the Kubernetes cluster nodes to create and present persistent, virtual volumes into containers.  Ondat is designed to feel familiar to Kubernetes users - storage is managed through standard StorageClasses and PersistentVolumeClaims, and features are controlled by native Kubernetes Labels  and selectors, prefixed with storageos.com/.  Caching is enabled by default to improve read performance and compressed to reduced network traffic.

Key Ondat components are:

* *Ondat Cluster Operator*
+
Creates and maintains the Ondat storage cluster by ensuring all relevant components are running. 

* *Ondat Controlplane*
+
Monitors and maintains the state of volumes and nodes, working with etcd to maintain state consensus. 

* *Ondat Dataplane*
+
Handles all I/O path related tasks, including reading, writing, compression, and caching. 

* *Ondat Scheduler*
+
Helps ensure applications are scheduled on the same node as their volumes. 

* *CSI Helper*
+
Registers Ondat with Kubernetes as a CSI driver, creating and deleting volumes in response to PersistentVolumeClaims. 

* *Ondat API Manager*
+
Facilitates communication between various APIs and the Ondat Controlplane API.  It continually monitors the state of the cluster and moves it towards the desired state as necessary.



== Prerequisites

// Minimum requirements (prerequisites) for this guide
// * Requirement 1 https://url[url]
// * Requirement 2 https://url[url]

Ensure that you have checked that the following prerequisites have been met before proceeding to the next section. 

* https://www.suse.com/products/suse-rancher/[SUSE Rancher]

** Ensure that you have a SUSE Rancher Kubernetes cluster with at least 3 worker nodes and sufficient https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/[Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)] permissions to deploy and manage applications in the cluster.
For more guidance, see the https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/[Rancher documentation]. 

** Ensure that you have enough block storage available on each of the worker nodes, as Ondat will utilize this to create a single storage pool for storing persistent data.

== Installation

//Provide steps or link to existing document.
//[source, bash]
//---
//echo "Use code blocks for command-line steps."
//---

Installing Ondat into your SUSE Rancher Kubernetes cluster is easy.  The recommended installation methods are:
1. Through the https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/helm-charts/[SUSE Rancher Apps & Marketplace] using the https://github.com/rancher/partner-charts/tree/main/charts/ondat-operator/ondat-operator[Ondat Helm Chart].
2. With the https://docs.ondat.io/docs/reference/kubectl-plugin/[Ondat kubectl plugin].


In this guide, you will use the Ondat kubectl plugin to install Ondat and deploy an etcd cluster operator in your SUSE Rancher Kubernetes cluster.


1. Install local path provisioner.
+
By default, a newly provisioned SUSE Rancher Kubernetes cluster does not have a deployed CSI driver.
+
Run the following commands against the cluster to deploy a https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner[Local Path Provisioner] to provide local storage for an etcd cluster.
+
NOTE: The Local Path Provisioner stores all data locally on the individual nodes and is not recommended for production installations. 
+
[source, bash]
----
# Install the local path provisioner.
kubectl apply --filename="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/v0.0.21/deploy/local-path-storage.yaml"

# Inspect the status of the pod and storageclass.
kubectl get pod --namespace=local-path-storage
kubectl get storageclass
----


2. Conduct preflight checks.
+
Run the following kubectl-storageos plugin command to conduct preflight checks against the SUSE Rancher Kubernetes cluster to validate that key Ondat prerequisites have been met before proceeding.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Conduct preflight checks.
kubectl storageos preflight
----


3. Create your Ondat credentials.
+
Define and export the __STORAGEOS_USERNAME__ and __STORAGEOS_PASSWORD__ environment variables that will be used as your credentials to access and manage your Ondat instance.
+
[source, bash]
----
export STORAGEOS_USERNAME="admin"
export STORAGEOS_PASSWORD="password"
----


4. Install Ondat.
+
Run the following __kubectl-storageos__ plugin command to install Ondat.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Install Ondat.
kubectl storageos install \
  --include-etcd \
  --etcd-tls-enabled \
  --etcd-storage-class="local-path" \
  --admin-username="$STORAGEOS_USERNAME" \
  --admin-password="$STORAGEOS_PASSWORD"
----
+
NOTE: The installation process may take a few minutes.


5. Verify the Ondat installation.
+
Once installation is complete, inspect Ondatâ€™s resources.  The core components should all show a status of __RUNNING__.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Inspect Ondat resources that have been created.
kubectl get all --namespace=storageos
kubectl get all --namespace=storageos-etcd
kubectl get storageclasses | grep "storageos"
----

6. Apply a licence to the cluster.
+
Newly installed Ondat clusters will run unlicensed for 24 hours without any limitations.
Thereafter, the Ondat cluster must be licensed to ensure that new operations, such as volume provisioning or adding nodes, continue to work.
+
Review the https://docs.ondat.io/docs/operations/licensing[licensing overview] to learn about Ondat licensing and how to obtain a free trial.



== Configuration

Now that you have Ondat successfully deployed and running, you need to create a custom Ondat __StorageClass__ and configure it as the default for the cluster.

This enables key Ondat features, such as:
+
* [Replication](https://docs.ondat.io/docs/concepts/replication/)
* [Topology-Aware Placement (TAP)](https://docs.ondat.io/docs/operations/tap/)
* [Encryption](https://docs.ondat.io/docs/reference/encryption/)


1. Define custom region https://docs.ondat.io/docs/reference/labels/[feature labels] for the nodes in the cluster.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Label the worker nodes to define custom regions for the TAP feature.
kubectl label node demo-worker-node-1 custom-region=1 
kubectl label node demo-worker-node-2 custom-region=2
kubectl label node demo-worker-node-3 custom-region=3
kubectl label node demo-worker-node-4 custom-region=1
kubectl label node demo-worker-node-5 custom-region=2

# Check that the worker nodes have been labeled successfully.
kubectl describe nodes | grep "custom-region"
----


2. Create a custom Ondat StorageClass, named __ondat-replication__.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Create the Ondat StorageClass.
cat <<EOF | kubectl create --filename -
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ondat-replication
provisioner: csi.storageos.com
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: ext4
  storageos.com/replicas: "2"
  storageos.com/topology-aware: "true"
  storageos.com/topology-key: "custom-region"
  csi.storage.k8s.io/secret-name: storageos-api
  csi.storage.k8s.io/secret-namespace: storageos
EOF
