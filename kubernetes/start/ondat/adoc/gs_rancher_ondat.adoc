== Technical overview

// Architecture diagrams

image::rancher_ondat_arch-diagram-high-level.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]


// Description
Ondat uses storage attached to the Kubernetes cluster nodes to create and present persistent, virtual volumes into containers.  Ondat is designed to feel familiar to Kubernetes users - storage is managed through standard StorageClasses and PersistentVolumeClaims, and features are controlled by native Kubernetes Labels  and selectors, prefixed with __storageos.com/__.  Caching is enabled by default to improve read performance and compressed to reduced network traffic.


image::rancher_ondat_arch-diagram-components.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]


Core Ondat components are:

* *Ondat Cluster Operator*
+
Creates and maintains the Ondat storage cluster by ensuring all relevant components are running. 

* *Ondat Controlplane*
+
Monitors and maintains the state of volumes and nodes, working with etcd to maintain state consensus. 

* *Ondat Dataplane*
+
Handles all I/O path related tasks, including reading, writing, compression, and caching. 

* *Ondat Scheduler*
+
Helps ensure applications are scheduled on the same node as their volumes. 

* *CSI Helper*
+
Registers Ondat with Kubernetes as a CSI driver, creating and deleting volumes in response to PersistentVolumeClaims. 

* *Ondat API Manager*
+
Facilitates communication between various APIs and the Ondat Controlplane API.  It continually monitors the state of the cluster and moves it towards the desired state as necessary.



== Prerequisites

// Minimum requirements (prerequisites) for this guide
// * Requirement 1 https://url[url]
// * Requirement 2 https://url[url]

Ensure that you have checked that the following prerequisites have been met before proceeding to the next section. 

* Kubernetes cluster with at least 3 worker nodes.

== Installation

//Provide steps or link to existing document.
//[source, bash]
//---
//echo "Use code blocks for command-line steps."
//---

Installing Ondat into your SUSE Rancher Kubernetes cluster is easy.  Two recommended methods are:

. Through https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/helm-charts/[SUSE Rancher Apps & Marketplace] using the https://github.com/rancher/partner-charts/tree/main/charts/ondat-operator/ondat-operator[Ondat Helm Chart].

. With the https://docs.ondat.io/docs/reference/kubectl-plugin/[Ondat kubectl plugin].


In this guide, you will use the Ondat kubectl plugin to install Ondat and deploy an etcd cluster operator in your SUSE Rancher Kubernetes cluster.


. Install local path provisioner.
+
By default, a newly provisioned SUSE Rancher Kubernetes cluster does not have a deployed CSI driver.
+
Run the following commands against the cluster to deploy a https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner[Local Path Provisioner] to provide local storage for an etcd cluster.
+
NOTE: The Local Path Provisioner stores all data locally on the individual nodes and is not recommended for production installations. 
+
[source, bash]
----
# Install the local path provisioner.
kubectl apply --filename="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/v0.0.21/deploy/local-path-storage.yaml"

# Inspect the status of the pod and storageclass.
kubectl get pod --namespace=local-path-storage
kubectl get storageclass
----


. Conduct preflight checks.
+
Run the following kubectl-storageos plugin command to conduct preflight checks against the SUSE Rancher Kubernetes cluster to validate that key Ondat prerequisites have been met before proceeding.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Conduct preflight checks.
kubectl storageos preflight
----


. Create your Ondat credentials.
+
Define and export the STORAGEOS_USERNAME and STORAGEOS_PASSWORD environment variables that will be used as your credentials to access and manage your Ondat instance.
+
[source, bash]
----
export STORAGEOS_USERNAME="admin"
export STORAGEOS_PASSWORD="password"
----


. Install Ondat.
+
Run the following kubectl-storageos plugin command to install Ondat.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Install Ondat.
kubectl storageos install \
  --include-etcd \
  --etcd-tls-enabled \
  --etcd-storage-class="local-path" \
  --admin-username="$STORAGEOS_USERNAME" \
  --admin-password="$STORAGEOS_PASSWORD"
----
+
NOTE: The installation process may take a few minutes.


. Verify the Ondat installation.
+
Once installation is complete, inspect Ondat’s resources.  The core components should all show a status of __RUNNING__.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Inspect Ondat resources that have been created.
kubectl get all --namespace=storageos
kubectl get all --namespace=storageos-etcd
kubectl get storageclasses | grep "storageos"
----

. Apply a licence to the cluster.
+
Newly installed Ondat clusters will run unlicensed for 24 hours without any limitations.
Thereafter, the Ondat cluster must be licensed to ensure that new operations, such as volume provisioning or adding nodes, continue to work.
+
Review the https://docs.ondat.io/docs/operations/licensing[licensing overview] to learn about Ondat licensing, including free options.



== Configuration

Now that you have Ondat installed and running, you need to create a custom Ondat StorageClass and configure it as the default for your cluster to enable these key features:

* [Replication](https://docs.ondat.io/docs/concepts/replication/)
* [Topology-Aware Placement (TAP)](https://docs.ondat.io/docs/operations/tap/)
* [Encryption](https://docs.ondat.io/docs/reference/encryption/)


Follow the steps below to configure your Ondat cluster.


. Define custom region https://docs.ondat.io/docs/reference/labels/[feature labels] for the nodes in the cluster.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Label the worker nodes to define custom regions for the TAP feature.
kubectl label node demo-worker-node-1 custom-region=1 
kubectl label node demo-worker-node-2 custom-region=2
kubectl label node demo-worker-node-3 custom-region=3
kubectl label node demo-worker-node-4 custom-region=1
kubectl label node demo-worker-node-5 custom-region=2

# Check that the worker nodes have been labeled successfully.
kubectl describe nodes | grep "custom-region"
----


. Create a custom Ondat StorageClass, named __ondat-replication__.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Create the Ondat StorageClass.
cat <<EOF | kubectl create --filename -
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: ondat-replication
provisioner: csi.storageos.com
allowVolumeExpansion: true
parameters:
  csi.storage.k8s.io/fstype: ext4
  storageos.com/replicas: "2"
  storageos.com/topology-aware: "true"
  storageos.com/topology-key: "custom-region"
  csi.storage.k8s.io/secret-name: storageos-api
  csi.storage.k8s.io/secret-namespace: storageos
EOF
----


. Mark the custom Ondat StorageClass as default for the cluster.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Set as default.
kubectl patch storageclass ondat-replication -p '{"metadata": {"annotations":{"storageclass.kubernetes.io/is-default-class":"true"}}}'

# Inspect the StorageClass and ensure it's now the default.
kubectl get storageclasses | grep "ondat-replication"
----

Your Ondat cluster is now configured.


Before proceeding to the demonstration, follow the steps below to deploy and run the https://docs.ondat.io/docs/reference/cli/#run-the-cli-as-a-deployment-in-your-cluster[Ondat CLI utility as a deployment] so that you can interact and manage Ondat through kubectl.

. Deploy the CLI utility in the __storageos__ namespace.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Create the deployment for the Ondat CLI.
cat <<EOF | kubectl create --filename -

== Demonstration

//Describe use case and demonstration.

Next, you will explore how Ondat with SUSE Rancher helps ensure that stateful workload data are always highly available by:

. Deploying a stateful application that leverages the __ondat-replication__ StorageClass created earlier.

. Simulating a node failure scenario to demonstrate how Ondat's replication feature is able to quickly fail over to a new replica volume when a master volume suddenly goes permanently offline.


=== Deploy a stateful application

For this demonstration, you will deploy MongoDB as the stateful application, using the https://github.com/percona/percona-postgresql-operator[MongoDB operator] developed and maintained by Percona.

. Deploy the  operator with kubctl.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Create a namespace for the operator.
kubectl create namespace mongodb

# Deploy the MongoDB operator.
kubectl --namespace=mongodb apply --filename="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb-operator/v1.11.0/deploy/bundle.yaml"

# Inspect that the status of the pod is in a `Running` state.
kubectl get pods --namespace=mongodb
----


. After the operator is ready, create the database cluster itself from the example __cr-minimal.yaml__ custom resource located in the MongoDB operator repository.
+
[source, bash]
----
# Deploy the database cluster.
kubectl --namespace=mongodb apply --filename="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-server-mongodb-operator/v1.11.0/deploy/cr-minimal.yaml"

# Inspect and wait until that the resources have been successfully created in the `mongodb` namespace.
kubectl get pods --namespace=mongodb
----


. Once the database is running, you will notice that Ondat automatically created two replica volumes for each master volume.  Verify this with the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
# Get the volumes in the `mongodb` namespace using `kubectl`
kubectl get pvc --namespace=mongodb

----

As shown in this output, the master volume and each replica volume are deployed on a different nodes to ensure data protection and high availability in the event of a transient node failure.
This is the TAP feature in action, which is leveraging the custom regions node labels that were created earlier.


=== Simulate a node failure

Ondat automatically fails over to a replica volume on a different node in the event of a sudden node outage.  To see this, you will purposefully delete the node hosting the stateful application's master volume.

From the output of the previous command, you know that the master volume resides on __demo-worker-node-2__ and the related replica volumes reside on __demo-worker-node-1__ and __demo-worker-node-3__.

When __demo-worker-node-2__ goes offline, Ondat automatically detects that the master volume no longer exists and elects one of the replicas to become a master as well as creates a new replica on a different node to maintain the defined replica volume count.


NOTE: The nodes where the volumes reside may be different for your cluster.  Ensure that you substitute the correct node names in the commands below.


. Delete __demo-worker-node-2__ (containing the master volume).
+
[source, bash]
----
# Delete the node with a master volume.

In this example output, notice that Ondat elected the replica volume on __demo-worker-node-3__ to host the master volume since __demo-worker-node-2__ no longer exists.
Also notice that a new replica volume was automatically created on __demo-worker-node-5__ to ensure that the replica count remains at two, as defined.



== Summary

//Summarize the motivation
//Summarize what was demonstrated
//Hint at other capabilities.

In this guide, you:

* Deployed Ondat into a Kubernetes cluster in your SUSE Rancher cloud native landscape.
* Created a custom StorageClass, which enabled replication and Topology-Aware Placement (TAP) to guarantee two replica volumes distributed on nodes in different availability zones.
* Demonstrated how Ondat can automatically detect an offline master volume, elect a replica volume to become master, and create a new replica on a different node to maintain the defined configuration.

With Ondat and SUSE Rancher, you can create a Kubernetes native stack that ensures your critical, stateful workloads are highly available and durable.
