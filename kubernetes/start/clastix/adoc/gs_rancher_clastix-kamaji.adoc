== Introduction

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a brief statement (1-4 sentences) of the purpose of the guide.
// This is could be the same as the executive summary.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Efficiency, security, and cost savings are top concerns for most businesses.
This becomes particularly important for large enterprises, who need to share Kubernetes infrastructure and resources between multiple teams, departments, or business units.
These are also concerns for managed services providers, who offer Kubernetes-as-a-Service or leverage Kubernetes to deliver other services.

Multi-tenancy enables different users or tenants to securely share Kubernetes resources, simplifying administration and reducing costs.
Multi-tenancy is recognized as key to achieving these goals.
Yet Kubernetes does not have first-class concepts of end users or tenants.

By integrating :kamaji_full: into your :product1_full: environment, you gain:

* A highly scalable and high-density Kubernetes control plane infrastructure.
* Reduced operational overhead, yielding faster deployment, configuration, upgrades, and maintenance.
* Consistent configurations across multiple tenants.
* Distributed architectures across clouds, edge, and data center.
* Hard multi-tenancy with strong security and isolation.



=== Scope

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Specify what this guide covers in no more than 2 sentences.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Learn how to deploy :kamaji_full: into an existing Kubernetes cluster managed by :product1_full:.


=== Audience

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify for whom this document is intended, perhaps with:
//   - topics of interests (e.g., machine learning, security, etc.)
//   - job roles (e.g., developer, administrator, platform architect, etc.)
//   - required skills
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Systems architects, platform engineers, administrators, and others seeking efficient operation of Kubernetes infrastructure through multi-tenancy and secure workload isolation will find this guide relevant.

A basic understanding of Kubernetes and cluster management with :product1_full: is needed.


== Prerequisites

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify minimum requirements (prerequisites) the reader
// would need in order to follow the steps of this guide.
// - Link to existing resources whenever possible.
// - Keep this section brief but elaborate as needed.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

For this guide, you need the following:

* {product1_url}[{product1_full}]
//
+
You can follow this guide with {rancher_url}[{rancher_full}] {product1_version} or later, which enables support for {rancher_url_docs}integrations-in-rancher/rancher-extensions[Rancher Extensions].
See {rancher_url_docs}[Rancher Deployment Quick Start Guides] for setting up your Rancher environment.

* A Kubernetes cluster to be the Kamaji Admin Cluster and managed by Rancher.
+
--
Any CNCF-certified Kubernetes cluster can be used, including {rke2_url}[RKE2] and {k3s_url}[K3s].
Follow the instructions of your chosen Kubernetes distribution for proper setup of the Kamaji Admin Cluster.

For this guide, in addition to the cluster's control plane nodes, you need at least 3 worker nodes.
Each worker node should have the following minimum specifications:

* 2 vCPUs

* 2 GB of RAM

* 16 GB storage

* Swap disabled

* Full network connectivity between all machines


Your Kamaji Admin Cluster also must provide the following services:

* A Container Storage Interface (CSI) module installed with a defined {rancher_url_docs}pages-for-subheaders/create-kubernetes-persistent-storage[Storage Class] for the tenant datastores.
For example, you can use {longhorn_url}[Rancher Longhorn] or any other persistent storage system.
The {lpp_url}[Rancher Local Path Provisioner] is also an option.

* Support for {k8s_url_docs}concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer[Load Balancer] service types, such as {metallb_url}[MetalLB] or one provided by your cloud provider.
The addresses provided by the load balancer must be accessible by the worker nodes of the tenant clusters as well as by tenant users.

* {k8s_url_docs}concepts/services-networking/ingress-controllers/[Ingress Controller].
The Kamaji Console is exposed through Ingress, so the cluster needs an Ingress controller.
For RKE2 and K3s installations, you an ingress controller is installed by default.
For other Kubernetes distributions, such as AKS, EKS, or GKE, you may need to deploy the ingress controller before continuing.

* {certmanager_url}[Cert-Manager].
Kamaji takes advantage of dynamic admission control, such as validating and mutating webhook configurations.
These webhooks are secured by https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security[Transport Layer Security (TLS)], and the certificates are managed by Cert-Manager.

--

* An arbitrary number of Linux machines to host multiple tenant worker nodes.
These can be bare metal systems or virtual machines, on-premises or in any cloud.
For this guide, each tenant worker node should have at least:
+
--
* 2 vCPUs

* 2 GB of RAM

* 16 GB of storage

* Swap disabled

* Full network connectivity between all machines
+
[NOTE]
====
Kubernetes components communicate through various {k8s_url_docs}reference/networking/ports-and-protocols/[network ports and protocols].

{kamaji_url}[{kamaji_full}] turns any CNCF-compliant Kubernetes cluster into an “Admin Cluster” to orchestrate other Kubernetes clusters called “tenant clusters.”
With Kamaji the tenant control planes run in pods on the Admin Cluster instead of on dedicated machines.
This makes running Kubernetes at scale less costly, easier to deploy, and simpler to operate while providing users with a fully managed, native Kubernetes experience.

After a tenant cluster is created, you can import it into {product1_url}[{product1_full}] for centralized management of your Kubernetes landscape.
Rancher Prime enables global administrators to streamline operations, improve consistency and security through an intuitive interface or through GitOps-driven workflows.


=== Components and tools

Key Kamaji components discussed in this guide are:

Kamaji Operator::
+
--
The Kamaji Operator is installed on the Admin Cluster.
It is responsible for creating and monitoring multiple custom resources called tenant control planes (TCPs).

* The Kamaji Operator continuously checks for any deviations or changes in the TCPs.
If it detects any drift, such as misconfigurations or inconsistencies, it initiates immediate reconciliation to bring the TCPs back to their desired states.

* The Kamaji Operator rolls out new versions of TCPs and seamlessly migrates between different datastores.
It ensures smooth transitions and minimizes disruptions during updates or changes to the control plane infrastructure.

--

Kamaji Console::
//
+
The Kamaji Console is a Web-based, graphical interface for global administrators.

Tenant Control Plane (TCP)::
Running in the Admin Cluster as pods, tenant control planes provide dedicated control plane capabilities for each tenant cluster.
They expose the control plane endpoint (the address and port) to the tenant’s worker nodes through a balanced and secure network service.

Datastore::
Installed on the Admin Cluster, the datastore is responsible for storing the state of the tenant clusters into a multi-tenant capable datastore as etcd running on the Admin Cluster.
The relationship between the datastore and TCPs can be one-to-one or one-to-many.
Thanks to {kine_url}[kine] integration, an open-source component from SUSE acting as a shim for etcd, Kamaji supports other datastore types, including PostgreSQL and MySQL.
+
[TIP]
====
It is highly recommended that you use a managed datastore in production, such as {cloudnativepg_url}[CloudNativePG], an open source, PostgreSQL distribution for Kubernetes.
You can also use the {kamajietcd_url}[kamaji-etcd] Helm chart to set up a multi-tenant etcd datastore, running as a StatefulSet of three replicas.
====

Tenant Worker Nodes::
Tenant worker nodes run workloads of the respective tenants.
They consist of virtual or bare metal machines that are connected to the TCP through a secure network connection.
Tenant worker nodes can be isolated by infrastructure for hard multi-tenancy and can run on different infrastructures in data centers, clouds, and edge locations.


Konnectivity::
Konnectivity is a cloud-native network technology that facilitates traffic between the TCP and the worker nodes.
It establishes a secure tunnel between the TCP and the tenant worker nodes, which is especially useful when the worker nodes are not directly reachable from the TCP.


You can find additional details in the {kamaji_url_docs}[Kamaji documentation].

+
image::clastix-kamaji_10_extension-menu.png[Rancher Extensions - Multitenancy Management menu, scaledwidth="70%", align="center"]



== Provision a tenant cluster

With the Kamaji Operator, the Kamaji Console, and the Kamaji Rancher Extension deployed to your Kamaji Admin Cluster, you are ready to provision tenant (downstream) clusters.


=== Deploy a tenant control plane

The first step to provision a tenant cluster is to create a tenant control plane (TCP) in the Kamaji Admin Cluster.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Tenant control plane pods are exposed by a load balancer service that is the 'ControlPlaneEndpoint' for the worker nodes.
Make sure your Kamaji Admin Cluster supports the creation of the 'LoadBalancer' service type and that IP addresses can be provisioned and assigned.
Otherwise, the Kamaji Operator will wait indefinitely to deploy your tenant control plane.
====

. In the Rancher UI, select your Kamaji Admin Cluster.

. Select __Multitenancy Management__ and click __Kamaji Console__.
+
image::clastix-kamaji_11_extension-console.png[Rancher Extensions - launch Kamaji Console, scaledwidth="70%", align="center"]
+
The Kamaji Console opens in another tab or window of your browser.

. Log into the Kamaji Console UI with the email address and password you set during deployment.

. In the Kamaji Console, select __Tenant Control Planes__ in the left panel, then click __Create__.
+
image::clastix-kamaji_12_tcp-create.png[Tenant Control Planes - Create, scaledwidth="60%", align="center"]

. You are presented a sample TCP YAML file for configuring the tenant control plane.
Adjust Kubernetes version, ServiceType, and other values for your infrastructure.
+
image::clastix-kamaji_13_tcp-create-editor.png[Create TCP editor, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]
+
For convenience, a sample TCP YAML file is provided below.

----
+
[NOTE]
====
If you are not using the default namespace, make sure the namespace exists before applying the configuration.
====

. Click __Create__ to deploy the tenant control plane.
//
+
The Kamaji Operator creates the tenant control plane as declared in the TCP YAML file, including Secrets to store the certificates used to access the tenant cluster.

. You can see an overview of the 'sample' tenant control plane that was created in the Kamaji Console.
+
image::clastix-kamaji_14_tcp-sample.png[Tenant Control Plane overview, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

. Click __VIEW KUBECONFIG__ to retrieve the Kubeconfig for your tenant control plane and save it as the file, `default-sample.kubeconfig`.


=== Prepare worker nodes

Be sure the bare metal or virtual machines you will use as your worker nodes have the following components installed:

* containerd

* crictl

* kubectl

* kubelet

* kubeadm

[TIP]
====
The `nodes-prerequisites.sh` script can automate installation of these prerequisites for Ubuntu 20.04 and can be modified for your preferred operating system.
====


=== Join worker nodes

The tenant control plane is made of pods running in the Kamaji Admin Cluster.
At this point, the tenant cluster has no worker nodes.
So, the next step is to join some worker nodes to the tenant control plane.

Kamaji leverages the https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api[Cluster Management API (CAPI)] project.
This allows you to create the tenant clusters, including worker nodes, in a completely declarative way.
Refer to the https://github.com/clastix/cluster-api-control-plane-provider-kamaji[Kamaji CAPI providers repository] to learn more about supported providers.


The current approach for joining nodes is to run a `kubeadm` command on each node.

. Open the command line on your Linux workstation.

. Store the IP address (or hostname) of each node in a variable.
+
[source, console]
----
WORKER0=<address of first node>
WORKER1=<address of second node>
WORKER2=<address of third node>
----

. Store the join command in a variable.
+
[source, console]
----
JOIN_CMD=$(echo "sudo ")$(kubeadm --kubeconfig=default-sample.kubeconfig token create --print-join-command)
----

. Use a loop to log into and run the join command on each node.
+
[source, console]
----
HOSTS=(${WORKER0} ${WORKER1} ${WORKER2})
for i in "${!HOSTS[@]}"; do
  HOST=${HOSTS[$i]}
  ssh ${USER}@${HOST} -t ${JOIN_CMD};
done
----

. You can check the status of the worker nodes from the command line with:
+
[source, console]
----
kubectl --kubeconfig=default-sample.kubeconfig get nodes
----

[TIP]
====
This process can be further automated to handle the node prerequisites and joining.
See https://github.com/clastix/yaki/tree/master[yaki nodesetup.sh script], which you could modify for your preferred operating system.
====


=== Install the Cluster Network Interface

Your tenant cluster also needs a {rancher_url_docs}faq/container-network-interface-providers[Container Network Interface (CNI)] plugin.
The CNI plugin enables seamless communication and connectivity between containers and external networks.
For this guide, you use the {calico_url}[Calico] CNI.

. Download the latest, stable Calico manifest to your Linux workstation.
//
+
For example:
+
[source, console]
----
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.24.1/manifests/calico.yaml -O
----

. Apply the manifest to your tenant cluster.
+
[source, console]
----
kubectl --kubeconfig=default-sample.kubeconfig apply -f calico.yaml
----
+
[TIP]
====
You can check the status from the command line:

[source, console]
----
kubectl --kubeconfig=default-sample.kubeconfig get nodes
----
====

. When the nodes are ready, they are visible to you in the Kamaji Console.
+
image::clastix-kamaji_15_console-tenant-nodes-visible.png[Tenant Nodes in the Kamaji Console, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]


== Import the tenant cluster into Rancher Prime

Bring your tenant clusters into {product1_full} for unified management and oversight of your Kubernetes landscape.

. Log into the Rancher UI.

. In __Cluster Management__, select __Clusters__.

. Click __Import Existing__.

. Enter a 'Cluster Name'.

. Click __Create__.

. Copy the `kubectl` command displayed in the Rancher UI to your clipboard and run it against the tenant cluster on the command line of your Linux workstation.
+
[WARNING]
====
Make sure you use the Kubeconfig related to the tenant cluster you wish to import.
====

. Your tenant cluster is in a 'Pending' state while Rancher deploys resources to manage it.
This may take a few minutes.
