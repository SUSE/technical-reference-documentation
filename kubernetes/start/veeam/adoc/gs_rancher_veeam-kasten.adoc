== Prerequisites

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify minimum requirements (prerequisites) the reader
// would need in order to follow the steps of this guide.
// - Link to existing resources whenever possible.
// - Keep this section brief but elaborate as needed.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

For this guide, you will need the following:

* Rancher by SUSE
//
+
In this guide, we use {productname}.
+
See https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/installation/requirements/[Rancher installation guide] for more information.

* Kubernetes cluster managed by Rancher
//
+
Any CNCF-certified Kubernetes cluster can be used.
+
See https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/rancher-v2-6-3/[Rancher Support Matrix]

* Storage for backup target
//
+
An external backup storage target, such as an NFS file server or cloud object store.
This document uses an external, S3-compatible object storage bucket.

* User application to demonstrate backup and restore capability
//
+
For example, WordPress can be easily installed by https://bitnami.com/stack/wordpress/helm[Helm chart].


{otherproduct1short} can be installed in a variety of different environments.
To ensure a smooth installation experience, you can use the primer tool to perform several pre-flight checks to make sure that the prerequisites are met. 
This tool runs in a pod in the cluster and does the following:

* Validates that the Kubernetes settings meet the {otherproduct1short} requirements.

* Catalogs the available StorageClasses.

* If a CSI provisioner exists, it will also perform a basic validation of the cluster's CSI capabilities and any relevant objects that may be required.
See https://docs.kasten.io/latest/install/storage.html#csi-preflight[CSI pre-flight checks] in the documentation for more details.


Run the following command to deploy the primer tool: 

[source, bash]
----
curl https://docs.kasten.io/tools/k10_primer.sh | bash
----

[NOTE]
====
This will create and clean up a ServiceAccount and ClusterRoleBinding to perform sanity checks on your Kubernetes cluster.
====



== Installing {otherproduct1short}


// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Detail the steps of the installation procedure.
// The reader should be able to copy and paste commands to
// a local environment or follow along locally with screenshots.
// Include one or more verification steps to validate installation.
//
// Leverage:
// - Ordered lists
// - Code blocks
// - Screenshots
// - Admonitions
//
// If multiple installation methods are to be detailed, then
// - Create a summary list here
// - Detail each method in its own subsection.
//
// NOTE: For solutions involving SUSE Rancher, it is preferred
//       to detail two installation methods:
//       - Through the Rancher Apps Catalog with appropriate
//         screenshots and SUSE branding.
//       - A more manual approach (e.g., on the command-line).
//
// Complex configuration procedures may be broken out into one or more
// Configuration sections.
// These may be subsections of Installation or separate sections at
// the same level as Installation.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =


{otherproduct1short} can be easily deployed from the Rancher Apps Catalog.

. Create a new https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/project-admin/namespaces/[namespace] for the {otherproduct1short} application.

.. In the Rancher user interface (UI), navigate to __Clusters__ -> __Project/Namespaces__.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_marketplace3.png[Rancher UI - Chart install 2, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

.. After setting your chart values, click __Next__, then click __Install__.


. Validate the installation.
+
To validate that {otherproduct1short} has been properly installed, run the following command in the "kasten-io" namespace and watch for the status of the pods:
+
[source, bash]
----
kubectl get pods --namespace kasten-io --watch
----
+
It may take a couple of minutes for all pods to come up and display "Running" status.
+
[source, bash]
----
kubectl get pods --namespace kasten-io

NAMESPACE     NAME                                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
kasten-io     aggregatedapis-svc-b45d98bb5-w54pr      1/1     Running   0          1m26s
kasten-io     auth-svc-8549fc9c59-9c9fb               1/1     Running   0          1m26s
kasten-io     catalog-svc-f64666fdf-5t5tv             2/2     Running   0          1m26s
...
----

[NOTE]
====
In the unlikely scenario that pods are stuck in any other state, see the https://docs.kasten.io/latest/operating/support.html#support[support documentation] to debug further.
====


== Accessing the {otherproduct1short} dashboard

. The {otherproduct1short} dashboard is not exposed externally by default.
To establish a connection, use the following `kubectl` command:
+
[source, bash]
----
kubectl --namespace kasten-io port-forward service/gateway 8080:8000
----

. Open your Web browser to `http://127.0.0.1:8080/{otherproduct1release}/#/`.


[NOTE]
====
If you are running on GKE and want to access the dashboard without local `kubectl` access, see https://docs.kasten.io/latest/access/gcp_details/gcp_console_dashboard.html[K10 Dashboard Directly From the Google Cloud Console].
====


https://docs.kasten.io/latest/access/authentication.html#id5[Direct access] to the {otherproduct1short} dashboard requires a properly configured authentication method to secure access.
For more information, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/[Kubernetes authentication].
The next two sections provide an overview of the steps you can follow to configure an authentication method.

Proceed by following the steps to configure either *basic authentication* or *token authentication* in the next sections.


=== Basic authentication

https://docs.kasten.io/latest/access/authentication.html#id6[Basic authentication] allows you to protect access to the {otherproduct1short} dashboard with a user name and password.

Enable basic authentication by first generating https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[htpasswd] credentials using either an http://www.htaccesstools.com/htpasswd-generator/[online tool] or via the `htpasswd` command found on most systems.
When generated, you need to supply the resulting string with the `helm install` or `helm upgrade` command using the following flags:

[source, bash]
----
--set auth.basicAuth.enabled=true \
--set auth.basicAuth.htpasswd='example:$apr1$qrAVXu.v$Q8YVc50vtiS8KPmiyrkld0'
----

Alternatively, you can use an existing secret contained in a file created with `htpasswd`.
The secret must be in the "kasten-io" namespace with the key named "auth" and the value as the password generated using `htpasswd`.

[source, bash]
----
--set auth.basicAuth.enabled=true \
--set auth.basicAuth.secretName=my-basic-auth-secret
----


=== Token authentication

https://docs.kasten.io/latest/access/authentication.html#id7[Token authentication] allows the use of any token that can be verified by the Kubernetes server.
For more information about token authentication, see:

* https://docs.kasten.io/latest/access/authentication.html#id8[Obtaining Tokens]
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/authentication/#authentication-strategies[Authentication Strategies]

[]

. Enable token authentication by using the following flag as part of the initial `helm install` or subsequent `helm upgrade` command.
+
[source, bash]
----
--set auth.tokenAuth.enabled=true
----

. Next, provide a bearer token that will be used when accessing the dashboard.
+
image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_token-login1.png[Kasten Sign In - bearer token, scaledwidth="50%", align="center"]


The most common token type that you can use is a service account bearer token.

. You can use `kubectl` to extract such a token from a service account that you know has the proper permissions.

.. Get the SA secret
+
[source, bash]
----
sa_secret=$(kubectl get serviceaccount my-kasten-sa -o jsonpath="{.secrets[0].name}" --namespace kasten-io)
----

.. Extract the token
+
[source, bash]
----
kubectl get secret $sa_secret --namespace kasten-io -ojsonpath="{.data.token}{'\n'}" | base64 --decode
----

. Alternatively, you can create a new service account from which to extract the token.
+
[source, bash]
----
kubectl create serviceaccount my-kasten-sa --namespace kasten-io
----
+
You can create a role binding or cluster role binding for the account to ensure that it has the appropriate permissions for {otherproduct1short}.
To learn more about permissions, see https://docs.kasten.io/latest/access/authorization.html#authz[Authorization].


=== {otherproduct1short} dashboard overview

The {otherproduct1short} dashboard is divided into several different sections, described below.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_dashboard-welcome.png[Kasten UI - Quick Tour, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

[TIP]
====
A guided tour is available when the {otherproduct1short} dashboard is accessed for the first time or via the option on the https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/overview.html#k10-settings[Settings] page.
====


The top of the {otherproduct1short} dashboard displays a list of applications currently mapped to namespaces, any policies that might exist in the system, and a summary of the cluster's backup data footprint.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_dashboard_overview-top.png[Kasten UI - dashboard, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

After filtering for applications that have stateful services (defined as containing a persistent volume), this screen further categorizes applications as:

* *Unmanaged*: There are no protection policies that cover this object.

* *Non-compliant*: A policy applies to this object, but the actions associated with the policy are failing (because of underlying storage slowness, configuration problems, etc.) or the actions have not been invoked yet.

* *Compliant*: These objects have policies, and the policy SLAs are being respected.

[TIP]
====
You can filter the view by clicking the __Compliant__, __Non-Compliant__, or __Unmanaged__ buttons.
====


The {otherproduct1short} platform equates namespaces to applications for ease of use and consistency with Kubernetes best practices.
This also allows use of role-based authentication controls (RBAC) and mirrors the most common application deployment patterns.
As shown later, policies can be defined to operate on more than one namespace or only operate on a subset of an application residing in a single namespace.

If you already have installed applications, clicking the __Applications__ card on the dashboard will provide you with details.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_dashboard-apps1.png[Kasten UI - Applications, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]


An application is made up of multiple Kubernetes resources and workloads, including deployments and stateful sets. 

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_dashboard-apps2.png[Kasten UI - Application Details, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]


{otherproduct1short} policies are used to automate your data management workflows.
Policies combine actions you want to take (such as making a snapshot), frequency or schedule for how often you want to perform the action, and selection criteria for the resources you want to manage.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_dashboard_overview-top.png[Kasten UI - Dashboard, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]


On the __Policies__ card, you notice that no default policies are created at install time.
A policy can be either created from this page or from the application page shown earlier.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_dashboard-policies.png[Kasten UI - Policies, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]



== Creating a location profile 

{otherproduct1short} can invoke protection operations, such as snapshots, within a cluster without requiring additional credentials.
This may be sufficient if {otherproduct1short} is running in the major public clouds and actions are limited to a single cluster.
It is not sufficient for most production situations, where performing real backups, enabling cross-cluster and cross-cloud application migration, and enabling disaster recovery are essential.

To enable these actions that span the lifetime of any one cluster, {otherproduct1short} needs to be configured with access to external object storage or external NFS file storage.
This is accomplished with location profiles.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_location-profiles1.png[Kasten UI - Location Profiles 1, scaledwidth="65%", align="center"]


Access profile creation from the __Settings__ icon in the top-right corner of the dashboard or via the https://docs.kasten.io/latest/api/profiles.html#api-profile[CRD-based Profiles API].
Location profiles are used to create backups from snapshots, move applications and their data across clusters and potentially across different clouds, and to subsequently import these backups into another cluster.

To create a location profile, click __New Profile__ on the profiles page.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_location-profiles2.png[Kasten UI - Location Profiles 2, scaledwidth="40%", align="center"]

When exporting to or importing from an object storage location, you must pick an object storage provider, a region for the bucket if being used in a public cloud, and the bucket name.
If a bucket with the given name does not exist, it will be created.

If you use an S3-compatible object storage system that is not hosted by one of the supported cloud providers, an S3 endpoint URL must be specified.

[NOTE]
====
When certain cloud providers (like AWS or Microsoft Azure) are selected, provider-specific options (such as IAM Roles) will appear for configuration.
====


When you click __Validate and Save__, the configuration profile is created and a profile similar to the following appears:

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_location-profiles3.png[Kasten UI - Location Profiles 3, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]


== Creating a policy

Protecting an application with {otherproduct1short} is usually accomplished by creating a policy.

In this section, you learn about snapshots and backups, scheduling, and selection in the context of application protection policies.

{otherproduct1short} defines an application as a collection of namespaced Kubernetes resources associated with

* a workload (such as ConfigMaps and Secrets),

* relevant non-namespaced resources used by the application (such as StorageClasses), 

* Kubernetes workloads (including Deployments, StatefulSets, standalone pods, etc.), 

* deployment and release information available from Helm v3, 

* and all persistent storage resources (such as PersistentVolumeClaims and PersistentVolumes).


While you can always create a policy from scratch through the policies page, the easiest way to define policies for unprotected applications is to click the __Applications__ card in the main dashboard.
This will allow you to see all applications in your Kubernetes cluster.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_dashboard-apps1.png[Kasten UI - Applications, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]


To protect any unmanaged application, simply click __Create a Policy__ to open the __New Policy__ dialog.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_policies_create1.png[Kasten UI - New Policy, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]


=== Snapshots and backups

All {otherproduct1short} policies center around the execution of actions.
You start by selecting the snapshot action with an optional backup (called an *export*).

See https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/protect.html#snapshots-and-backups[Snapshots and Backups] in the Kasten documentation for more details.


==== Snapshots

Snapshots form the basis of persistent data capture in {otherproduct1short}.
They are typically used in the context of disk volumes (PVC/PVs) used by the application but can also apply to application-level data capture (such as with https://docs.kasten.io/latest/kanister/kanister.html#kanister[Kanister]).

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_policies_create2.png[Kasten UI - Snapshot, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
Several public cloud providers (including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud) actually store snapshots in object storage, and they are retained independent of the lifecycle of the primary volume.
However, this is not true of all public clouds.
An independent backup would provide essential safety.
Check with your cloud provider's documentation for more information.
====

Snapshots, in most storage systems, are very efficient and have a very low performance impact on the primary workload, require no downtime, support fast restore times, and enable incremental data capture.

Storage snapshots usually suffer from constraints, such as having relatively low limits on the maximum number of snapshots per volume or per storage array.
Most importantly, snapshots are not always durable.
A catastrophic storage system failure will destroy your snapshots along with your primary data.
Further, in several storage systems, a snapshot's lifecycle is tied to the source volume.
So, if the volume is deleted, all related snapshots might automatically be garbage collected at the same time.

[TIP]
====
It is highly recommended that you create backups of your application snapshots to ensure durability.
====


==== Backups

Backups overcome the limitations of application and volume snapshots by converting them to an infrastructure-independent format, deduplicating, compressing, and encrypting them before they are stored in an external object store or NFS volume.

To convert your snapshots into backups, activate __Enable Backups via Snapshot Exports__ during policy creation.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_policies_create3.png[Kasten UI - Backup, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]



=== Scheduling

There are four components to {otherproduct1short} scheduling:

* Action frequency: how frequently the primary snapshot action should be performed

* Export frequency: how often snapshots should be exported to backups

* Retention schedule: how snapshots and backups are rotated and retained

* Timing: when the primary snapshot action should be performed



==== Action frequency

{otherproduct1short} snapshots can be set to execute at an hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly frequency, or on demand.
By default, hourly snapshots execute at the top of the hour, while weekly, monthly, and yearly snapshots execute at midnight UTC.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_backup-frequency.png[Kasten UI - Backup Frequency, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

You can also specify the time at which scheduled actions execute and sub-frequencies that execute multiple actions per frequency.
Sub-hourly actions can be useful when you are protecting mostly Kubernetes objects or small data sets.
See https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/protect.html#advanced-schedule-options[Advanced Schedule Options] in the Kasten documentation for more information.

[WARNING]
====
Care should be taken not to stress the underlying storage infrastructure or running into storage API rate limits.
Further, sub-frequencies do also interact with retention (described below).
For example, retaining 24 hourly snapshots at 15-minute intervals would only retain 6 hours of snapshots.
====


==== Export frequency

When __Enable Backups via Snapshot Exports__ is enabled, snapshots are exported as backups.
By default, every snapshot is exported, but you can limit this to a subset by selecting a daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly export frequency.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_export-frequency.png[Kasten UI - Export Frequency, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]



==== Retention schedule

A powerful scheduling feature in {otherproduct1short} is the ability to use a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_rotation_scheme#Grandfather-father-son [GFS retention scheme] for cost savings and compliance.
With this backup rotation scheme, hourly snapshots and backups are rotated each hour with one graduating to daily every day, daily snapshots and backups are rotated each day with one graduating to weekly, and so on.
You can set the number of hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly copies that need to be retained, and {otherproduct1short} will take care of cleanup.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_snapshot-retention-schedule.png[Kasten UI - Snapshot Retention, scaledwidth="65%", align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
It is not possible to set a retention schedule for on-demand policies.
====

The default backup retention schedule is the same as the snapshot retention schedule.
You can make these independent schedules, if needed.
This allows you to create policies where a limited number of snapshots are retained for fast recovery from accidental outages while a larger number of backups are stored for long-term recovery.
This separate retention schedule is also valuable when a limited number of snapshots are supported on the volume, but a larger backup retention count is needed for compliance.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_backup-retention-schedule.png[Kasten UI - Retention Schedule, scaledwidth="65%", align="center"]

Snapshots and backups created by scheduled runs of a policy can be retained and omitted from the retention counts by adding a `k10.kasten.io/doNotRetire: "true"` label to the https://docs.kasten.io/latest/api/actions.html#api-run-action[RunAction] created for the policy run.


[NOTE]
====
The retention schedule for a policy does not apply to snapshots and backups produced by https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/protect.html#manual-policy-runs[manual policy runs].
And you will need to clean up any artifacts created by manual policy runs.
====


==== Timing

By default, actions set to hourly execute at the top of the hour.
Other action frequencies execute at midnight UTC.

Unhide __Advanced Options__ to select how many times actions are executed within the frequency interval. 
For example, if the action frequency is daily, you can specify the hour of the day and the minutes after the hour when the action is to start.

You can also customize the retention schedule by selecting which snapshots and backups will graduate and be retained for longer periods.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_timing2-snapshot-retention.png[Kasten UI - Custom Snapshot Retention, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]


[TIP]
====
You can toggle whether to display and enter times in local time or UTC, but all times are converted to UTC and do not change for daylight savings time.
====


=== Selection

You can specify which applications are bound to a policy by name or label.


==== Application name

The most straightforward way to apply a policy to an application in {otherproduct1short} is to use its name (derived from the name of the namespace).
You can even select multiple application names for the same policy.

If you need a policy to span similar applications, use the asterisk ('\*') wild card.
For example, if you specify 'mysql-*', {otherproduct1short} will match all applications whose names start with 'mysql-'.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_selection-by-name-wildcard.png[Kasten UI - Select Applications, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
For policies that need to span all applications, use the asterisk wild card by itself.
====



==== Application label

You can also use labels to bind a policy to multiple applications.
For example, you could protect all applications that use MongoDB or applications that have been annotated with, say, the 'gold' label.
Matching occurs on labels applied to namespaces, deployments, and statefulsets.
If multiple labels are selected, a union (logical OR) will be performed, matching all applications with at least one of the labels.

Label-based selection can be used to create forward-looking policies, as such policy would automatically apply to any future application with the matching label.
For example, if you use a label of 'heritage: Tiller' (for Helm v2) or 'heritage: Helm' (for Helm v3), the selector will apply the policy to any new Helm-deployed applications because the label is applied to any Kubernetes workload created by the Helm package manager.

==== Other resources

{otherproduct1short} can also protect cluster-scoped resources without targeting any applications.
To specify this, select __None__.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_selection-cluster-scoped.png[Kasten UI - Select Applications - All Cluster-Scoped Resources, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

For more information about protecting cluster-scoped resources, see https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/clusterscoped.html#clusterscoped[Cluster-Scoped Resources].


==== Customization

You can further customize what is and what is not covered under a {otherproduct1short} application protection policy with:

* https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/protect.html#namespace-exclusion[namespace exclusions]

* https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/protect.html#exceptions[exceptions]

* https://docs.kasten.io/latest/usage/protect.html#resource-filtering[resource filtering]



== Working with policies

When you have created a policy and have navigated back to the main {otherproduct1short} dashboard, you see the selected applications quickly switch from unmanaged to non-compliant.
That is, a policy covers the objects, but no action has been taken yet.
The applications will switch to compliant as snapshots and backups are run and the application enters a protected state.
You can also scroll down the page to see the activity, how long each snapshot took, and the generated artifacts.

[NOTE]
====
More detailed job information can be obtained by clicking the in-progress or completed jobs.
====


=== Manual policy runs

You can manually run a policy by clicking the __run once__ button on the desired policy.
Any artifacts created by this action will not be eligible for automatic retirement and will need to be manually cleaned up.

=== Restoring existing applications

Restore an application via the __Applications__ page in the {otherproduct1short} dashboard.
To restore an application, simply click the __restore__ icon in the application's card. 

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_restore-app1.png[Kasten UI - Applications - Restore, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
While {otherproduct1short} uses the "export" term for backups, no import policy is needed to restore from a backup.
Import policies are only needed when you want to restore the application into a different cluster.
====

Next, you select a restore point.
These are distinguished in {otherproduct1short} as having been generated manually or automatically through a backup policy.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_restore-app2.png[Kasten UI - Restore Points, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

A restore point may include snapshots (native to the cluster) and backups (exported outside the cluster) with the same data.
When both snapshots and backups are present, the {otherproduct1short} provides you with the option to select the instance you want to use to restore the application.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_restore-app3.png[Kasten UI - Restore Points - Instance, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]


Selecting a restore point brings up a side-panel containing more details on the restore point for you to preview before you initiate an application restore.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_restore-app4.png[Kasten UI - Restore Point - Details, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

When you click __Restore__, {otherproduct1short} automatically re-creates the entire application stack into the selected namespace.
This not only includes data associated with the original application but also the versioned container images.


[NOTE]
====
Restored PersistentVolumes may not have the annotations specified in the original PersistentVolume.
====


After the restore completes, you can go back to your application and verify that the state was restored to what existed at the time the restore point was obtained.


=== Restoring deleted applications

Restoring a deleted application follows nearly the same process, except that removed applications are not shown on the Applications page by default.
To discover them, you simply need to filter and select __Removed__.

image::rancher_veeam-kasten_k10_restore-deleted-app.png[Kasten UI - Restore Removed Application, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

When the filter is in effect, you see applications that {otherproduct1short} had previously protected but which no longer exist.
These can now be restored using the normal restore workflow.
