Enterprises embracing cloud native technologies, like containers and Kubernetes, seek efficiency, scale, and agility for their applications.
To simplify management of their expanding cloud native estates, enterprises turn to {comp4}, the open source platform designed to unify and streamline Kubernetes management across diverse infrastructures - data centers, clouds, and the edge.

The transition to cloud native is often gradual.
Developers and business units often need time to redesign legacy applications or adapt business practices.
Organizations may find that they must concurrently maintain both cloud native and traditional IT infrastructure, leading to higher material and operational costs and hindering the modernization effort.

{comp4} addresses this challenge by allowing enterprises to manage virtual machines (VMs) for legacy applications alongside containers within {comp4}.
With unified management of containers and VMs, organizations can consolidate their IT estates, reduce costs, and continue their modernization journeys.

Business continuity is also crucial for enterprise IT estates.
:comp2 provides policy-driven backup, disaster recovery, application mobility, and ransomware protection for cloud native environments.
Integrating :comp2-short with {comp4} extends its enterprise-grade business continuity to VMs as well.

:comp1-provider and :comp2-provider together empower enterprises to unify their IT infrastructure estates, decrease operational costs, and ensure business continuity across both traditional and cloud native workloads.



=== Scope

This guide provides an architectural overview and steps for deployment and configuration of :comp2 in a :comp1 environment.


=== Audience

The intended audience for this document includes solution and infrastructure architects, system administrators, platform engineers, virtualization administrators, and backup and recovery administrators.
A basic understanding of virtualization, Linux, and Kubernetes concepts and technologies is required to successfully follow and apply this guide.



== Architecture

image::veeam_kasten_arch.png[Rancher by SUSE and Kasten by Veeam, scaledwidth="100%", align="center"]

:comp2 is deployed to a :comp1 cluster, using the underlying RKE2 Kubernetes cluster for the control plane, and includes NGNIX ingress to serve the Kasten user interface (UI).
Once installed in the cluster, :comp2-short can view all namespaces and resources and administrators can create backup policies for namespaces or individual VMs.


=== Components

Component technologies used in this guide include:


* One or more physical Linux servers as worker nodes to host VMs
+
For this guide, {comp3-website}[{comp3}] {comp3-version1} is used as the worker node operating system.

* {comp1-website}[{comp1}] ({comp1-version1} or later) installed onto the RKE2 cluster and configured on each node

* {comp2-website}[{comp2}] ({comp2-version1} or later}) providing data protection

[NOTE]
====
Always check the current https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/[product support matrices] to ensure proper choice of product versions.
====


=== Additional resources

Additional resources you will need to follow the steps in this guide include:

* A workstation you will use to connect to and administer the cluster environment

* https://helm.sh[Helm] 3 Kubernetes package manager installed on your workstation

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/[Kubectl] command line tool installed on your workstation for accessing the Kubernetes API



== Prepare the environment

Before installing :comp2-short, you must first prepare your :comp1 environment.

. Deploy {comp1}
//
+
Detailed guidance is provided in the {comp1-docs}[official documentation].
+
[NOTE]
====
A single-node cluster is sufficient for this guide.
====

. Create a virtual machine (VM) using {comp1} to host your Kubernetes cluster and applications.

. Plan your backup target storage in advance and ensure credentials are ready if using S3-compatible object storage.


== Procedure
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Detail the steps of the installation procedure.
// Replace 'Procedure' with one or more appropriate sections, such as:
// - 'Setting up the environment'
// - 'Installing the components'
// - 'Configuring and tuning'
// - 'Validating the deployment'
// You may find it useful to organize complex procedures into
// subsections.
//
// - As appropriate, make use of:
//   - Ordered lists for steps
//   - Code blocks for source code and console commands
//     Readers should be able to use copy and paste to leverage
//     commands and code in their environments
//   - Listing blocks for output
//   - Screenshots and diagrams
//   - Admonitions (notes, tips, warnings, etc.)
//
// NOTE: Always include some validation or verification in your guide.
//

// GK:
// Would it make sense to include a brief "Prepare your environment" section
// that outlines installation of SUSE Virtualization, linking to the existing
// documentation?

// GK:
// It might be helpful to provide some guidance on how to log in.

. After deploying a {comp1} cluster, 
log in to the https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/install/management-address[management IP] address and then navigate to the desired cluster.

. Click on _Support_ located at the bottom left of the navigation menu.
+
image::veeam_kasten_2_.png[Rancher by SUSE and Kasten by Veeam, scaledwidth="50%", align="left"]
+

. Select the _Download_ _KubeConfig_ option to save the cluster configration file to your workstation.
+
image::veeam_kasten_3_.png[Rancher by SUSE and Kasten by Veeam, scaledwidth="50%", align="left"]
+

. Place the downloaded file in the default Kubernetes config path. (typically ~/.kube on Linux and MacOSX). 
+

// GK:
// Presumably, the CLI commands below are executed in a terminal on the workstation.
// We should insert a step here to say, "Open a command terminal on your workstation."
+
// GK:
// Also, if this is the first time mentioning the RKE2 cluster, we might want to include an explanation.

. Open a command terminal on your workstation and confirm connectivity to the {comp1} RKE2 cluster using Kubernetes CLI command.
+
[source, bash]
----
kubectl get nodes
----
+

// GK:
// This appears to be the first mention of the harvester-longhorn storage class.
// It might be good to have a little explanation here that SUSE Virtualization
// uses Longhorn for block storage and that by annotating it, Kasten will
// be able to export block-mode disks.

. {comp1} uses Longhorn as its default block storage solution. 
To enable Kasten to export block-mode disks, annotate the `harvester-longhorn` storage class accordingly.

+
[source, bash]
----
kubectl annotate storageclass harvester-longhorn \
k10.kasten.io/sc-supports-block-mode-exports=true
----
+

. Similarly, annotate the longhorn-snapshot `volumesnapshotclass` so Kasten can use it to take storage snapshots.
+
[source, bash]
----
kubectl annotate volumesnapshotclass longhorn-snapshot \
k10.kasten.io/is-snapshot-class=true
----
+

. Add the _kasten_ repository to Helm.
+
[source, bash]
----
helm repo add kasten https://charts.kasten.io
----
+

. Install Kasten via Helm.
+
[source, bash]
----
helm install k10 kasten/k10 \
--namespace 'kasten-io' \
--create-namespace \
--set "ingress.create=true" \
--set-string "ingress.class=nginx" \
--set "auth.basicAuth.enabled=true" \
--set-string "auth.basicAuth.htpasswd=kasten:{SHA}3ddV7KLvFY/54nJZFXKfZHzF78k="
----
+
[NOTE]
====
This will install Kasten with basic authentication, with a username of ‘kasten’ and password ‘Kasten/4u!’.
If you wish to use a different username and password, you can do so by generating a different htpasswd string and replacing the string in the command above.
====
+

. Watch the Kasten pods and wait for all to have a status of RUNNING.
+
[source, bash]
----
watch ‘kubectl get pods -n kasten-io’
----
+

// GK:
// Is this the first mention of "SUSE Virtualization VIP"?
// If so, define it or use a different phrase.

. Using your web browser, enter the hostname or management IP address of the {comp1}, and append ‘/k10/’ to the end of the URL.
The Kasten dashboard should load and ask for a username and password.
Enter `kasten` and `Kasten/4u!` if you did not change the htpasswd string in the Helm installation command, otherwise enter the username and password you configured.
+
image::veeam_kasten_11_.png[Veeam Kasten Dashboard, scaledwidth="85%", align="left"]
+

. Kasten can now be configured to send backups to an external source.
To do so, navigate to _Profiles_ > _Location_ _Profiles_, choosing Add New and selecting the relevant storage provider and configuring authentication. Note that multiple location profiles can be defined, allowing administrators to send backup data to different locations depending on requirements, cost, etc.
+
image::veeam_kasten_12_.png[Veeam Kasten Create Location Profile, scaledwidth="85%", align="left"]
+

. Backup policies can now be configured to protect workloads.
To do so, navigate to Applications, click the menu to the right of a namespace you wish to protect, and select Create Policy.
+
image::veeam_kasten_13_.png[Veeam Kasten Applications, scaledwidth="85%", align="left"]
+

. The backup policy can now be defined, including scheduling and frequency, the retention schedule, and where to export backup data.
+
