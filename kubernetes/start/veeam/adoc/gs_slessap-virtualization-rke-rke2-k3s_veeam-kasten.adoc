Organizations adopt cloud native practices, leveraging containers and Kubernetes, to gain advantages of efficiency, scale, and agility for their application workloads.  SUSE Rancher Prime is the enterprise, open source, cloud native management platform of choice, enabling organizations to unify and streamline management of their Kubernetes estates wherever they are - in their data centers, in the clouds, and even at the edge.

Monolithic, legacy applications can be difficult to modernize.  This means that enterprises often need to separately maintain and manage traditional IT infrastructure for these applications while continuing their cloud native journeys.  The resulting inefficiency not only results in higher infrastructure and operational costs, they can slow modernization progress.

SUSE and Veeam help enterprises unify their IT landscapes.

With SUSE Virtualization enterprises get “day 1” and “day 2” management of VMs alongside containers in their cloud native estates.  This reduces operational overhead while giving organizations time to modernize legacy applications.  And, for business continuity, Veeam Kasten for Kubernetes provides backup, disaster recovery, mobility, and ransomware protection for both containers and VMs in this unified estate.

== Architecture

image::veeam_kasten_arch.png[Rancher by SUSE and Kasten by Veeam, scaledwidth="100%", align="center"]

Veeam Kasten is deployed to the SUSE Virtualization cluster, using the underlying RKE2 Kubernetes cluster for the control plane, and includes NGNIX ingress to serve the Kasten UI.  Once installed in the cluster, Kasten can view all namespaces and resources and administrators can create backup policies for namespaces or individual VMs.

=== Components

* SUSE Rancher Prime (v2.10.x or later) providing management of downstream clusters
* Two or more physical Linux servers as worker nodes to host VMs with a
* SUSE Linux Enterprise 6.1 is used for this guide.
* Downstream RKE2 (v1.3.1 or later) cluster on the worker nodes
* SUSE Virtualization (v1.4.1 or later) installed onto the RKE2 cluster and configured on each node
* SUSE Storage …

[NOTE]
====
Always check the current https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/[product support matrices] to ensure proper choice of product versions.
====

=== Additional resources

* A workstation you will use to connect to and administer the cluster environment
* https://helm.sh[Helm] 3 Kubernetes package manager installed on your workstation
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/[Kubectl] command line tool installed on your workstation for accessing the Kubernetes API

== Procedure
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Detail the steps of the installation procedure.
// Replace 'Procedure' with one or more appropriate sections, such as:
// - 'Setting up the environment'
// - 'Installing the components'
// - 'Configuring and tuning'
// - 'Validating the deployment'
// You may find it useful to organize complex procedures into
// subsections.
//
// - As appropriate, make use of:
//   - Ordered lists for steps
//   - Code blocks for source code and console commands
//     Readers should be able to use copy and paste to leverage
//     commands and code in their environments
//   - Listing blocks for output
//   - Screenshots and diagrams
//   - Admonitions (notes, tips, warnings, etc.)
//
// NOTE: Always include some validation or verification in your guide.
