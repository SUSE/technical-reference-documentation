== Introduction


image::logo-lockup_suse-aws_positive.svg[SUSE | Amazon Web Services, scaledwidth="50%", align="center"]


=== Motivation

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a motivation for the document in 2-4 sentences to identify:
// - what the document is about
// - why it may be of interest to the reader (e.g., a use case)
// - what products are being highlighted
// Include an approved SUSE | Partner logo lock-up if possible
// Include any additional, relevant details
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

{platform1} is a complete software stack for managing your entire Kubernetes landscape.
{productname} addresses the needs of DevOps teams, who are deploying applications with Kubernetes, and IT operations, who are responsible for delivering enterprise-critical services.
{productname} provides simple, consistent operations and unifies security, policy, and user management, whether you are running one Kubernetes cluster or thousands.

With _{offering1}_ in the {market}, you can easily install {productname}, enabling you to manage all your downstream clusters wherever a routable API address exists.


=== Scope

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Specify what this guide covers in no more than 2 sentences.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

In this guide, you learn how to install {productname} on {eks_long} using the _{offering1}_ listing in the {market}.

From a single ephemeral appliance, you launch a three-node EKS cluster in a geography of your choosing and install {productname} in this cluster using the current _rancher-stable_ release. 
From this management plane, you can begin to deploy or import downstream EKS or other Kubernetes clusters.

=== Audience

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify for whom this document is intended, perhaps with:
// - topics of interests (e.g., machine learning, security, etc.)
// - job roles (e.g., developer, administrator, platform architect, etc.)
// - required skills
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This document is intended for administrators, cloud architects, and others who are looking to manage Kubernetes at scale across multiple geographies and accounts within AWS or hybrid landscapes.
For this guide, you should have a basic understanding of Kubernetes and AWS concepts and services. 



== Prerequisites

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify minimum requirements (prerequisites) the reader
// would need in order to follow the steps of this guide.
// - Link to existing resources whenever possible.
// - Keep this section brief but elaborate as needed.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Before getting started, you should have:

* VPC, subnet, routing, and security group configurations sufficient to allow HTTPS access to the deployment host interface, as well as open access between the ephemeral appliance and the subnets where your EKS cluster will be configured

* Route53 registered domain

* EC2 SSH key pair



== Installation

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Detail the steps of the installation procedure.
// The reader should be able to copy and paste commands to
// a local environment or follow along locally with screenshots.
// Include one or more verification steps to validate installation.
//
// Leverage:
// - Ordered lists
// - Code blocks
// - Screenshots
// - Admonitions
//
// If multiple installation methods are to be detailed, then
// - Create a summary list here
// - Detail each method in its own subsection.
//
// NOTE: For solutions involving SUSE Rancher, it is preferred
// to detail two installation methods:
// - Through the Rancher Apps Catalog with appropriate
// screenshots and SUSE branding.
// - A more manual approach (e.g., on the command-line).
//
// Complex configuration procedures may be broken out into one or more
// Configuration sections.
// These may be subsections of Installation or separate sections at
// the same level as Installation.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

{platform1} is available in the {market} as the _{offering1}_ listing.

In this section, you use _{offering1}_ to instantiate an ephemeral appliance from which you deploy {productname} into a new {eks_long} cluster.



=== Prepare your environment

. Open https://console.aws.amazon.com/[AWS Console] and log in with your IAM user account.
+ 
image::aws-mp-rancher-01.png[AWS login, scaledwidth="50%", align="center"]

. Verify your region, VPC, Subnet, and Security Group settings to allow public access to your deployment automation host and your Rancher management EKS cluster. 
+
[NOTE]
====
You can use the __Create VPC__ wizard to construct the required resources.
For detailed instructions on VPC networking or rules for Public and Private Subnets, reference https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/how-it-works.html[How VPC Works].

Be sure to take note of the public subnet name you have chosen for your initial automation node deployment.

image::aws-mp-rancher-02.png[VPC creation, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

image::aws-mp-rancher-12.png[Update IAM role for instance, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]




=== Deploy Rancher

. Wait for your instance to be in the _running_ state.

. Obtain the IP of the instance from the Instance Overview in the AWS Console.
+
[TIP]
====
Be sure to use the HTTPS URL for a secure connection.
The server certificate is self-signed, so you need to accept the security exception in your browser. 

image::aws-mp-rancher-13.png[Instance public IP address, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]
====

. Obtain the user name and password for the instance.
+
[TIP]
====
The user name is the EC2 Instance ID, and the initial password is the AWS account ID without dashes.

You can obtain the Instance ID from the AWS console.

image::aws-mp-rancher-14.png[Instance ID, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]
====

. Return to the {offering1} UI and click __Login__.

. Use the user name and password you just obtained to log in.
+ 
image::aws-mp-rancher-15.png[Rancher Setup login, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

. Read the information provided, then click __Next__.
+ 
image::aws-mp-rancher-16.png[Rancher Setup information, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Wait for AWS Policy Simulator to check IAM permissions, then click __Next__.
//
+
If an error occurs at this stage, then the role was not correctly applied to the instance.
+ 
image::aws-mp-rancher-17.png[AWS Policy Simulator, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Choose a region for deploying your {eks_long} management cluster, then click __Next__. 
+

+ 
image::aws-mp-rancher-19.png[Size of management cluster, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]
+
[TIP]
====
'SMALL' works for most initial deployments.
The instance that runs the {productname} cluster can be resized when needed.
====

. Enter the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) for your {productname} management server, then click __Next__.
//
+
[NOTE]
====
The subdomain containing the FQDN must be preconfigured as an AWS Route53 hosted zone.
====
image::aws-mp-rancher-20.png[Rancher URL, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Take note of the URL at which {productname} will be served, then click __Next__ to begin deployment of {productname}.
+ 
image::aws-mp-rancher-21.png[Deploy Rancher on AWS EKS, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

== Accessing {productname}

. Open a Web browser to the URL of your {productname} service.

. Enter the initial password, which you noted earlier, and click __Log in with Local User__.
+
image::aws-mp-rancher-23.png[Rancher first login, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. When prompted, enter and confirm a new password for the 'admin' user, accept the terms and conditions, then click __Continue__.
+ 
image::aws-mp-rancher-24.png[Rancher new password, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. You can now open your browser to the Rancher UI with the FQDN you provided during setup.
For example, https://rancher.example.com.
+
image::aws-mp-rancher-25.png[Rancher UI - Welcome, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. Terminate the temporary instance you created for the deployment automation to improve security and save costs. 
+ 
image::aws-mp-rancher-30.png[AWS Terminate Instance, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

. You can now create a 'Cloud Credential'  
+
image::aws-mp-rancher-31.png[Rancher - Create Cloud Credential, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]
and deploy or import downstream clusters and node groups for workloads. 
+
image::aws-mp-rancher-32.png[Rancher - Create EKS Cluster, scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

[NOTE]
====
The initial 3-node management cluster does not count against your {productname} node count for _Priority Support_, which you may purchase through the {market}.
====
 

== Priority support

image::rancher-prime-logo-color.svg[Rancher Prime, scaledwidth="25%", align="center"]

Elevate your Rancher landscape to https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/quick-start-guides/deploy-rancher-manager/prime[{productname2}].
{productname2} enables you with priority support, security assurances, extended lifecycles, access to focused architectures and Kubernetes advisories, and more.

Purchase {productname2} via the {market} with the _{offering2}_ listing for your geography.

image::aws-mp-rancher-34.png[Rancher Priority Support offerings, scaledwidth="85%", align="center"]

You can also purchase {productname2} via your normal AWS or SUSE sales channel or by contacting aws@suse.com directly to request a private offer.


Once activated, a billing and metering container runs in your environment that validates the support entitlement you purchased through the {market} with the quantity of managed, downstream cluster nodes.
This instantiates _{productname2}_ status for your deployment.


If you procured {offering2} via the {market}, you can get support by generating a 'supportconfig' and uploading it via the https://scc.suse.com/[SUSE Customer Center (SCC)].
If you procured {offering2} directly from SUSE, then you can create support tickets via SCC using the credentials you received as part of the transaction.


[NOTE]
====
The three-node EKS cluster deployed with {offering1} is supported at no additional cost and does not count against the purchased supported node count.

Also, your supported downstream cluster nodes can be located anywhere - in multiple clusters, geographies, data centers, edge devices, and clouds.
