== Introduction
In this getting started guide we will walk through the install of {platform1} on {otherproduct3} for managing downstream clusters wherever a routable API address exists. 


=== Motivation

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a motivation for the document in 2-4 sentences to identify:
// - what the document is about
// - why it may be of interest to the reader (e.g., a use case)
// - what products are being highlighted
// Include an approved SUSE | Partner logo lock-up if possible
// Include any additional, relevant details
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

Rancher addresses the needs of DevOps teams deploying applications with Kubernetes, and IT operations delivering enterprise-critical services.
In this document, you learn how to launch {platform1} from the {otherproduct2} listing.
This single automation node will, in turn, launch a 3-node EKS cluster in a geography of your choosing, and install Rancher as pods across this cluster. This will represent the management plane for managing your downstream clusters.


=== Scope

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Specify what this guide covers in no more than 2 sentences.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

At the end of the process, you have a functional Rancher UI, and can deploy or import downstream EKS or other clusters, and deploy and maintain applications via the built-in partner charts, and manage your whole Kubernetes landscape from core to cloud to edge.


=== Audience

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify for whom this document is intended, perhaps with:
// - topics of interests (e.g., machine learning, security, etc.)
// - job roles (e.g., developer, administrator, platform architect, etc.)
// - required skills
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This document is intended for customers wanting to manage Kubernetes at scale across multiple geographies and accounts within AWS or hybrid landscapes.
Administrators and cloud architects should have a basic understanding of Kubernetes and AWS concepts and services. 


== Prerequisites

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify minimum requirements (prerequisites) the reader
// would need in order to follow the steps of this guide.
// - Link to existing resources whenever possible.
// - Keep this section brief but elaborate as needed.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

* A standard IAM user account with the attached permissions of 'AdministratorAccess' (or equivalent permissions for creating and assigning IAM policies and roles to an EC2 instance) is sufficient for initial deployment.
Additional permissions will be given to the deployment host for creating clusters, networking components, and Route53 DNS zone entries. 
* VPC, subnet, routing and security group configuration sufficient to allow https access to the deployment host web UI, as well as open access between the deployed instance and the subnets where the EKS cluster will be configured.

* Route53 registered domain. 

* EC2 SSH keypair.


== Technical overview

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a technical overview of the solution.
// - Identify components.
// - Describe how the components fit together.
// Leverage diagrams as appropriate, including (but not limited to):
// - component architecture
// - data flow diagram
// - workflow diagram
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

The {otherproduct1} marketplace listing will deploy an automation node, which in turn, allows the administrator to deploy {platform1} within a new {otherproduct3} cluster.

//Architectural Diagram TBD


== Installation

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Detail the steps of the installation procedure.
// The reader should be able to copy and paste commands to
// a local environment or follow along locally with screenshots.
// Include one or more verification steps to validate installation.
//
// Leverage:
// - Ordered lists
// - Code blocks
// - Screenshots
// - Admonitions
//
// If multiple installation methods are to be detailed, then
// - Create a summary list here
// - Detail each method in its own subsection.
//
// NOTE: For solutions involving SUSE Rancher, it is preferred
// to detail two installation methods:
// - Through the Rancher Apps Catalog with appropriate
// screenshots and SUSE branding.
// - A more manual approach (e.g., on the command-line).
//
// Complex configuration procedures may be broken out into one or more
// Configuration sections.
// These may be subsections of Installation or separate sections at
// the same level as Installation.

// Illustrate functionality with a demonstration.
// Begin with a description or outline of the demonstration.
// Provide clear steps (in ordered lists) for the reader to follow.
// Typical demonstration flow is:
// 1. Prepare the environment for the demonstration.
// This should be minimal, such as downloading some data to use.
// If this requires more than a couple steps, consider putting it
// in a subsection.
// 2. Perform the demonstration.
// Be careful not to overuse screenshots.
// 3. Verify.
// This may be interwoven into performing the demonstration.
//
// As with Installation, leverage ordered lists, code blocks,
