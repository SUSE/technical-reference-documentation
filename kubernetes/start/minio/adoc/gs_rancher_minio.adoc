https://www.suse.com/products/suse-rancher/[SUSE Rancher] is the enterprise Kubernetes and container management platform that simplifies and unifies multi-cluster management, enabling consistent operations, workload management, and enterprise-grade security across your entire Kubernetes landscape - on-premises, in the cloud, and at the edge. 
 
https://min.io/product/multicloud-suse-rancher[MinIO] provides Kubernetes-native, consistent, performant, and scalable object storage.  MinIO is S3-compatible, ensuring a familiar API workspace for an entire ecosystem of developers and software platforms.  MinIO natively integrates with SUSE Rancher and the Rancher toolchain, such as the kubectl CLI and the Istio service mesh, enabling infrastructure and DevOps teams with streamlined storage operations across multiple clouds and at the edge. 
 
The combination of MinIO with SUSE Rancher empowers enterprises with a powerful, easy-to-use solution to scale and consistently manage applications across any multi-cloud and hybrid-cloud infrastructure.


=== Scope

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Specify what this guide covers in no more than 2 sentences.
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This guide will introduce some general concepts and basic steps for installing, configuring, and using MinIO Object Storage in a SUSE Rancher Kubernetes environment.

This guide will also provide a general framework for connecting Spark, Presto, or other AI/ML platforms with support for the S3A connector to MinIO for high performance, scalable data workloads within Kubernetes.



=== Audience

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify for whom this document is intended, perhaps with:
//   - Topics of interests
//   - Potential job roles
//   - Required skills <- This can be critically important
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =

This document is intended for DevOps, IT Professionals, application administrators, and developers who are responsible for building, managing, and using cloud-native object storage resources.



== Technical overview

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Provide a technical overview of the solution.
// Identify components.
// Describe how the components fit together.
// Leverage diagrams as appropriate, including (but not limited to):
//   - component architecture
//   - data flow
//   - workflow
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =





== Prerequisites

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Identify minimum requirements (prerequisites) the reader
//   would need to have to follow the steps of this guide.
// Link to existing resources whenever possible
//   but don't be afraid to elaborate as needed.

// * Requirement 2 https://url[linktext]
// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =




== Installation

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Detail the installation steps in an ordered list.
// The reader should be able to copy and paste commands
// to a local environment or follow along with screenshots.
//
// If multiple installation methods are discussed,
// create a list here, then detail each method in a subsection.
//
// NOTE: For solutions involving SUSE Rancher, it is preferred
//       to include installation through the Rancher Apps & Marketplace
//       with appropriate screenshots that show SUSE branding
//       as well as link to or detail a command-line method.

== Demonstration

// = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
// Describe use case / functionality to be demonstrated, followed by
//   the demonstration itself.
// Typical demonstration flow is:
//   1. Prepare (environment for demonstration)
//   2. Perform (actions of demonstration)
//   3. Verify (demonstration worked)
// Depending on the size and complexity of each step,
//   the demonstration can be broken into subsections.
